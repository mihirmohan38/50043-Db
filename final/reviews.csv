13,B000FA64PK,"[0, 0]",3,"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600

21,B000FA64QO,"[0, 0]",2,"With Ylesia, a novella originally published in e-book form, Walter Jon Williams gets an opportunity to insert further story into his novel Destiny's Way. The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Minor New Jedi Order side story,1331769600

However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14), which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel, so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises.","05 17, 2011",AQZH7YTWQPOBE,Enjolras,A Thrackan story,1305590400

27,B000FBFMVG,"[5, 5]",3,"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.","08 25, 2008",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee,1219622400

This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

35,B000FC1BN8,"[1, 1]",3,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).","09 24, 2010",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Enjoyable Imperial slice-of-life story,1285286400

42,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",2,"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me.","01 17, 2013",A1YEPFLLH42OU1,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""",An average short story,1358380800
43,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",5,"I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

Since then I have read several more of L'Amour's books and have enjoyed all of them.  I will review them here over the next few weeks, time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras ""aphorisms"", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word ""psychic"", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase ""judicial action"" to connote ""reflection-free"".  He's fond of the word ""unwisdom"", which Hartranft translates as ""not seeing things as they are"".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.","06 21, 2014",A6J7GN6ZOR085,lonebeaut,Compare and contrast for a better understanding,1403308800

L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.","06 11, 2013",A1U360OMVQRPUB,Mel Odom,Brionne,1370908800

For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.","03 3, 2012",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey",1330732800

First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.

After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.

No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article.

93,B000GFK7L6,"[7, 8]",3,"When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.","12 8, 2010",A30YCQ4MOZAI6Y,Michelle R,I love the NYT -- sometimes.

However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.

I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.

I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess).

If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there).

114,B000JMKNQ0,"[4, 4]",4,"Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order,1331769600

This time, Karen Traviss combines fan favorite Boba Fett and NJO favorite Nom Anor to show the Mandalorians' role in the Yuuzhan Vong war. Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical, but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.Even for a short story, it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more, or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion.

This is more of Karen Traviss' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty, infallible, infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians, who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual, Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story. This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books. You're lucky if she doesn't tell you how, when, and where Boba acquired his underwear, and what they're made of.Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of Traviss' work. I consider her Star Wars books to be a notch below Barbara Hambly's disastrous efforts. Read this only if you're a huge fan of Traviss, or a huge fan of Non-Canon Star Wars books... Because this one can't stand up to scrutiny.","08 13, 2009",A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,A Good Reason Not to Miss Traviss' Star Wars Books,1250121600

When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.  I would have loved to read more of her work in a Star Wars setting.","05 18, 2013",A12LKEM543ILBK,zombie phreak,Terrific!!!,1368835200

I kept wanting to say, ""Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.""The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.  While this is an exciting story, I never really cared if the characters lived or died except for what would happen to the child.","10 17, 2009",A109E01LB4H38F,"Carol Donaho ""Carol Donaho""",Way too fast!,1255737600

Pooter, a senior bank clerk in the City renting a home in a London suburb of Holloway, encapsulates Victorian respectability, snobbery, and pretensions. Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours. What's a father to do?First serialized in Punch in 1888 and 1889, The Diary of a Nobody was published in book form in 1892 and hasn't been out of print since.

It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow.

This book was written during World War 1. The Western Front in the subtitle is the line where the westward-moving German army was being met by the armies of the countries they were invading. Arnold Bennett was a novelist who was Director of Propaganda for France at the Ministry of Information during the war. That's the background, on to the book...Bennett tells of the time he spent moving from town to town in France and Belgium along the Front. He is always escorted by a military officer, and they often walk through trenches and have to take cover if an artillery shell explodes nearby. He frequently goes into detail about towns and buildings that have been damaged or destroyed by the Germans. It's not a very personal book- he seldom writes about people he meets or relates conversations. Occasionally he muses on the absurdity of what the Germans are doing, and what it is costing in terms of people's lives and livelihoods. His cynicism shines through at those moments. The book will be best enjoyed by war buffs, but it's short, and an excellent description of a war zone, so I recommend it to people who don't normally read war books as well.","04 5, 2010",A39A6B9YR9R0L6,Phil,Life on the Western Front during World War 1,1270425600

To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.

Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.","07 30, 2011",A5CA9579GD7HJ,Bob Jarvis,Handyman's Journal,1311984000

""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist. This book is a classic for a reason.","02 12, 2011",AFFGYGNO989PD,"Elizabeth H. Cottrell ""RiverwoodWriter""",Rollicking adventure,1297468800

It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale.

The only complaint was that there was a lot of detail put into all the different mechanisms they had to make.

They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties.

Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the ""what one book would you want with you on a desert island?"" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt ""Smith"" was a ""gypsy name"" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character. You can find that version in the kindle store here:The Mysterious Island)Oh, yeah, Captain Nemo. This book is in some ways a sequel to Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas_, as well as to his _In Search of the Castaways_. The sequence isn't direct -- really more a case of cameo characters than a direct plot sequel to either book -- but you might want to read those two books first before picking this one up.","06 11, 2010",A1KPDKD7VYRE3B,T.

It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.","07 18, 2010",A50EGYZY7RHGI,"Brian K.

Sure, the money is for admin fees..a joke. He cries continually over money and references fees all around.

359,B000JQUSBQ,"[3, 4]",5,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary.

361,B000JQUSBQ,"[42, 45]",4,"There are twenty-nine stories in this collection. These Indian tales resemble the stories that flourished in Europe, such as the tales by the Brothers Grimm and by Aesop, although they have an Indian flavor. The collector of these stories contends that they are very old, older than the legends and folk-tales that later flourished in Europe. He believes that India was the originator of this genre and the stories were possibly brought to Europe by the crusaders or other travelers that passed through India.For example, the tale The Lion and the Crane is well-known. A lion was eating an animal when a bone got stuck in its throat. A crane offered to help if the lion promises not to eat it. The lion agrees. The crane protects itself by placing a stick in the lion's mouth to keep it open while he is inside the lion's mouth removing the bone. As soon as the crane removes the bone, it pushes out the stick and flies off to a high tree. Later, the crane asks the lion what the lion will give it for saving the lion's life. The lion responds that it already gave the crane a gift by not eating it. The Indian version ends by speaking about the transmigration of souls, a belief of many Indians. The lion and the crane were people in another life.How the Raja's Son Won the Princess Labam is another example of a familiar tale, although known in the west under other names. A prince goes in search for a beautiful princess. While journeying, he takes out his food and finds an ant in it. He places it on the ground for other ants to come and finish it. The ant Raja arrives and tells him that since he fed the ants, if he needs help in the future all he need do is think of them and they will come to help him. He leaves and continues searching for the princess. He comes across a tiger with a thorn in its paw. He helps the tiger who tells the prince that if he needs help in the future, he should think of him, and he and his wife will come and help him. The prince continues his search and comes across four fakirs with four magic items: a bag that give food whenever it is requested to do so, a bowl that offers water, a bed that flies and can take the prince where he wants to go, and a stick that will beat any group that tries to harm him. He takes the four items from the fakirs. He uses the bed to go to the princess. He uses the bag and bowl for food and drink. He then uses the ants and tigers and the bed when the princess' father insists that he performs tasks before he will give up his daughter. The final fourth task that the father insists that he perform is one that none of his friends or magical items can help him with. But the princess tells him how to do the task. The story ends by stating that the two lived happily and never needed to use the magic stick.","10 15, 2010",A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,Israel Drazin,Delightful stories that are similar to European tales,1287100800

381,B000JQUT8S,"[0, 0]",3,"Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' most liked and popular novels.Authors, let this be a lesson to you -- create terrific villains.Oliver Twist himself is a twerpy nobody 90% of the books. Okay, he asks for a second bowl of gruel. He fights to defend the good name of his mother. He walks to London in a week. That's all good, but it's all in the first quarter of the book.Afterward he does nothing but get entrapped by criminals. And be such an obvious goody-goody he becomes the friend of the victims instead.Indeed, the man who has a handkerchief stolen by the other two boys, and the family Bill Sykes tries to use Twist to rob turn out to be not only current friends but related to his real family.No author today could get away with such outrageous coincidences.The ending is a sentimental mishmash. He has a half-brother who hates him, and people are involved in complicated plots I could neither follow nor believe.What makes this novel live on is the portrait of Fagin the leader of a gang of child thieves. And the violent robber Bill Sykes and his girlfriend the prostitute (though you have to read between the lines to figure this out), who started with Fagin as a thief when only 4.Although he avoids direct sexual subjects, Dickens otherwise nothing to pretty up the reality of London's underworld of crime and poverty. Dickens got Twist out of this environment as fast as he could, but was wise to keep going back to the criminals, who are the only interesting people in this novel.Dear sweet Oliver and Rose just make us gag.","03 3, 2012",AS6HL0VD7H8PA,"Richard Stooker ""Author, Virgin Blood""",Great villains,1330732800

389,B000JQUTGK,"[0, 0]",4,"This book filled a lot of gaps in the Lincoln story.  It consists of a series of anecdotes remembered by contemporaries of Abe Lincoln.  Many are humorous  stories or jokes that he liked to tell and many are reiterated by more than one person.  Some are sayings lifted out of speeches that he made, especially that occurred during the Lincoln/Douglas debates.  These stories are more or less placed in chronological order from Abe's boyhood days through his whole life experience and end the evening of his assassination as he prepared to go to the Ford Theater.  These saying as remembered as coming from the very mouth of the to be 16th President prove that his was a life-long aversion to slavery in all of its forms.  I have read opinions that his interest was in the preservation of the Union more than the end of slavery, but I think these quotes from Lincoln's own mouth show his horror and outrage against slavery from his early manhood, not to minimize his desire to preserve the Union.Another area is Lincoln's faith.  These stories from Abe's own mouth show his devout faith in Christianity, the Bible, and prayer from his boyhood, and his ever intensifying faith as the horrors of the Civil War ran their course.  I have read opinions by contemporaries in his law-practice days that Lincoln was an atheist or at best an agnostic.  No statements of that nature come from Abraham's mouth in this book, and if at all true would seem to reflect a stage of questioning in his early professional days before he became a candidate for office.Several more observations can be made:  I did not know that he had been in love twice before the alliance with Mary Todd.  One girl named Anne or Annie had been engaged to someone from the East before she was enamored with Lincoln.  The eastern swain had gone back east to get permission from his relatives as he considered himself to be of a higher class and needed the permission of his family in order to marry the western Annie.  During the absence of the Easterner, Annie sickened and died.  Abe was devastated.  He wept at her grave and was disconsolate for a long time.  Mary Todd was his third love.  I hadn't remembered that  another suitor of Mary's was Douglas, the Little Giant, Lincoln's political rival.  Douglas was short, round, and well-dressed.  Most would have predicted that he would be Mary's choice, however, she unpredictably picked Lincoln, the ungainly, rustic giant.  It was commented that Mary saw the diamond inside the rough exterior.Another interesting thread was the many threats and assassination attempts that were made against Lincoln's life from the beginning of his political success and his unconcern about them.  He stated that he believed his life was secure until his Maker called for it.  He astounded people by evading his body guards and taking unusual risks.  In the last days of the war, he visited the front lines against all advice.  By the time the hue and cry arose to forbid such a risky act, he had already been there and safely returned.This collection was evidently put together and edited quite close to time of the events.  Much of the language is archaic to my ear, and when explanations are made to help the reader understand, they are still geared to a much earlier generation.  Some of the jokes lost their humor for me because of the archaic language.  At that time, the general public evidently thought that three of our presidents had been poisoned for political ends as their vice presidents would be more favorable to the desired policies.  These stories were not given as controversial but as the accepted opinion of the day and were mentioned to show that there were grounds to believe the story of a White House kitchen worker who said he had been offered a large amount of money to poison the milk of the Lincoln household.  (The teetotaler family drank milk as their favored beverage.)  The poisoned presidents were considered to have been William Harrison, and the Generals Taylor and Scott.","03 1, 2014",A3H10TBPGHYSII,"Patricia C.

395,B000JQUU00,"[0, 0]",4,"In my review, I'm more comparing how this book meets my expectations based on what I have read from the more well known fairy tale compilers like the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson.  Some of these English fairy tales are very familiar, but they are not always quite how I know them.The first impression I had was that this book is more varied in terms of 'fairy tales'.  There are a lot of folk tales, and silly children's stories that don't have any moral or resolution really (""Master of all Masters springs to mind, as a short tale that seems to have the point of reciting silly words).  There is also a fixation on the name Jack for a lot of these characters.  I just thought that was interesting.  I wonder if they are all the same person.  There is also references to King Arthur and his court which I found very fascinating because some of these tales seem grounded in realistic detail.  They mention Kings who reigned and real locations in England as having seen the events in the story.  It makes the tales a little less fantastical, even when there are giants roaming the English countryside.Probably the tale that most surprised me was the story of Dick Whittington which now I realize I confused with the French ""Puss in Boots"" fairy tale.  Dick Whittington's story is much less magical, and more about being lucky enough to have a very industrious cat who likes to hunt mice.  ""Mr. Fox"" kind of stood out to me for its implied romance, gruesomeness, and the confrontation by the heroine. There are not too many stories in this book that are the same ilk. And lastly a story that I was surprised to see included was ""The Golden Arm"" which I was always more familiar with as a ghost story.  But now I know it is definitely a very old one.With the more realistic settings, sometimes whimsical nature of a few tales, and the English slang that is used at times, this book of fairy tales is rather different from what I'm used to.  I find it very interesting to read the original of familiar tales and see how things have changed.  For instance ""The Story of the Three Bears"" is more familiar to readers as ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears.""  In the original story there is no Goldilocks - rather the intruder is a very disagreeable old woman.  This book is definitely worth a read, for something different than the usual stories and perhaps to find some new favorite fairy tales.","04 23, 2013",A1Q434SYE6K31Q,Charlene,"Surprising, intriguing and wonderful",1366675200

397,B000JQUU00,"[21, 22]",5,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""once upon a time."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.","12 9, 2010",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,A Great Collection of Fairy Tales,1291852800

They met on their wedding day for the first time; exchanged vows; and the next morning he left joining the army.Seven years later, Mallory is tossed from her home due no payment as her wandering husband's uncle stopped sending her allotment.  Fuming, Mallory comes to London to confront her husband and demand a divorce.  Not caring one iota for proper behavior, she rips his head off in front of his mistress.  When John realizes the screaming crone is his wife, he grabs her and leaves his mistress at home. Mallory proves he owns nothing as his fortune has been embezzled while he dallied.  Together they seek his missing relative who absconded with his money.

There's a dash of humor, a strong romance, and a nicely woven plot with good tension between the protagonists.Mallory and John meet on their wedding day.  Mallory is only sixteen and John just a few years older, they are uncertain of each other and resentful as their parents have arranged their marriage.  John must marry Mallory so she can keep her beloved castle and John marries Mallory out of duty (he does not want to see her lose her home) and out of a need to please his father, a man who publicly claims John but privately eschews him because he is not really his flesh and blood.The day after the wedding John leaves and joins the military determined to forge his own destiny and not the one dictated by his father.  Over the years he sends Mallory funds through his uncle but basically lives his own life without laying eyes on his wife.  He returns to England and is a sought after lover and quite the man about town.Mallory finds John in London, in his mistress's house no less, demanding a divorce.  She has lost her home to creditors and she is infuriated at her husband.  John is astounded to see Mallory and even more surprised to learn that she has no home and that he is deeply in debt.  Seems his uncle has been siphoning off his funds and even worse loan sharks are circling him.  John knows he could go to debtor's prison if he does not find his uncle who has conveniently skipped town.  As his wife, Mallory could suffer the same fate so they now are on the run.John's friend lands them a job on one of his family estates, John will become a steward while his friend hunts down his uncle.  Mallory agrees to this plan mostly because she feels she has no choice, she wants to avoid prison.At first it was almost impossible to like John; he was selfish and irresponsible.  Mallory is completely justified in her feelings.  Their time as estate managers brings out the best of both characters and also their insecurities.  John realizes he is self centered and thoughtless; Mallory confronts her lonely life and takes a hard look at her reserved manner with commoners.  John is likable, smooth and smart and best of all sincere, when he feels something he does not hold back.  Mallory is more cautious, after all she was the abandoned one in the marriage and she is also uncertain in social situations, she lacks John's natural charm.  She gets beyond these hindrances and grows into a much more confident woman.  As she understands her husband her heart opens to him more each day.  This is a sweet romance about discovery, the leads not only discover how much they love each other but they also discover how to become better people too.","09 27, 2010",A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,Melissa,Romantic tale of a husband and wife falling in love,1285545600

Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).

Zangara made Seaton House an exclusive hotel in the nineteen thirties and was later convicted of being a serial killer.  Lottie is overprotected by her five older brothers, so she is relishing the idea of solving a mystery or two while relaxing and hopefully finding a hot guy to fool around with while she's at it.  Arriving at Seaton House during a thunderstorm, Lottie meets Simon and falls instantly in lust but Simon clearly wants nothing to do with her.  Lottie's not giving up though; she plans to discover the mystery surrounding the house and Simon, all while trying to seduce him into bed, but strange things are happening.

The effect was jarring to me, and I really wanted to skip whole chapters, especially when she's describing her own body as ""hot"" and centerfold worthy. Made her a lot less likable.  Then there are the continuity issues. In chapter 3 her internal monologue includes, ""Mr. Lebeaux. God, I didn't even know his first name.""  Then a few pages later ""the portable lantern Simon had left..."" half a page later ""hoping Simon would suddenly remember..."" so you think, well maybe she does know his name after all. Then in the next chapter she asks him ""What's your name?...Your first name."" There's a couple of other gaffs too but that one nearly made me give up on the book.The heroine goes back and forth between contemplating how many guys she's been with in college to then saying things like ""I don't have a lot of experience at this,"" when she's underneath the hero.

There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".

Like the handful of other Kindle newspapers I've experienced, the Kindle edition of the International Herald Tribune is laid out well, is easy to navigate, and features a generous allotment of photographs.  I'd be tempted to buy it more often, or maybe even subscribe, if the subscription and/or single-issue price was just a bit lower.

I find myself learning about global issues that normally are not even touched on in the usual ""lowest common denominator"" fare on TV. Happenings in the arts and sciences are also covered.The Nation comes out once a week, which I find to be a good rate of publication for a magazine of this type. You don't get the breathless ""breaking news"" type of reporting (a la Wolf Blitzer) in The Nation, which I find refreshing, but the issues are current and usually of considerable importance. The editors have time to be editors and the writers have time to do their homework. It's a more measured, intelligent approach to the world than we've gotten used to with cable news and screaming-head blogs.I do not find The Nation to be all that left-wing. On the contrary, I find a balance of perspectives from left (mostly left-of-center) to center-right. Importantly, there are no ""Screaming of the Extremists"" portions. There are well-articulated viewpoints and the occasional intelligent debate.

You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.

You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.

(I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.

Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs.

Blonde hair, a figure to die for; she haunts his dreams and invades his waking moments.  He yearns to make her the love of his life and the mother of his children.  When he finds out she is moving back to town, his heart jumps for joy, all the while knowing that she probably won't even look at a man like him.Veronica Abbott has to get out from under her parents control, even though she has been married and widowed.  Moving back to her hometown, she decides to open a romance shop.  Taking a basket to the local fire department as a thank you for saving her childhood home from burning down, Veronica walks into the locker room and comes face to face with Dean Wolcott; the object of her secret teenage crush.  Veronica then proceeds to show him just how much she has missed him and is attracted to him.Dean wants Veronica with every ounce of his being.  He doesn't want to be her part time lover, he wants to be the love of her life forever.  He promises to give her time but is unsure if a girl like her will ever love him.Caught Off Guard was a naughty look at two people whose childhood crushes were still alive and strong years later.  I fell in love with Dean completely and absolutely because his intentions were so loving and so honorable.  I found myself wincing with Veronica's mannerisms and blatant sexuality, but after realizing how she wanted to finally be free from being controlled, I could see where she was coming from.  Caught Off Guard by Tonya Ramagos was a delightful read.

As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...Robert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.Lady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.Fortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.ARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.

EVERYTHING Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Sherlock Holmes is here: all 4 novels and all 56 short stories. The informative introduction by Loren D. Estleman is an added bonus (though it appears twice in this ebook version, once at the start of each of the 2 volumes as originally published in paperback by Bantam). This ebook edition is very well-formatted, comfortable to read, has an active TOC (in which the short stories are presented in proper order), and even accurately depicts the graphic representations in ""The Dancing Men,"" unlike many other versions which substitute the word ""graphics"" for the drawings. This is undoubtedly the very best Sherlock Holmes collection currently available in the Kindle Store. (The non-Holmes set of 10 ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is sometimes added to incomplete Holmes sets to boost their story total. There is no need for this complete Sherlock Holmes set to do so, but if you want it, ""Tales of Mystery and Terror"" is easily obtained separately as a public domain freebie in the Kindle Store.) So if you love reading these beloved classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries, this is THE ebook edition to purchase--and paying only $2.99 for Bantam quality (rather than going with some incomplete, unauthorized, no-name, ebook bundler) is a very good deal.ADDENDUM: Since the above was written Maplewood Books has come out with a now updated and truly complete edition of its own at 1/3 the price of this Bantam version.

It has a really nice mix of stuff - how better to say, it's kind of interesting musings about all kinds of things, not just books or technology.The postings are very well written, as we'd expect from Amazon. The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint. If you happen to not read this blog for about 2 days, the old postings disappear. And there's no way to go reload them. So if on Thursday, I've forgetten to or not bothered to read Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday postings - most certainly there will be no Monday material. Tuesday has a shot at an article or two if the Thursday entry is small. Wednesday will be there. It's just not much fun to not be able to read old posts.Oh it does not feed to iPhone.So this blog is free. Well how can anybody really complain? I'm an almost daily reader now.Apparently this blog is somewhere on Amazon, my best efforts to search for it could not find it.

603,B000R93D4Y,"[8, 8]",4,"Magical, Mystical, Sensual . . . Enjoyable! While definitely all about the sex, this story brings a clear plot and a well-thought world in which our heroes and heroine have the pleasure of interacting. Perhaps I should say heroes and heroines . . . as the dragons are most certainly a major player in the plot of the story.There is never any inter-species hanky panky occurring, but the plot outlines a world where the dragon and its rider are so connected that both the dragon and rider are able to share feelings - including the sexual urges and desire that occur when the dragon is coupling with its mate. Of course, those feelings are intense, and of course they last for a very long time. (Dragons may be able to keep it in check for a very long time, but when they let loose . . . one should apparently be ready for almost anything!)The shared feelings and a lack of available females leads to an openness within the community around sex, and while there is no voyeurism involved, interaction may not be entirely behind closed doors . . . especially during a wedding! The lack of females also leads to an accepted practice of knights sharing mates - which is the case in this particular story. While there are sexual interactions between Gareth and Belara only, once Belara and her mother are brought back to the lair, that quickly changes, and Lars is added to the mix.There is an attempt made to slowly introduce the reader to multiple partners and all of the sexual exploits that situation can bring about. But, truly, there is lots and lots of sex in many different ways, shapes and forms. Outside of the sex, the plot does continue, and there is an epic battle scene described, and Belara's mother encounters the healing powers of a dragon. It's after this battle that Belara finds her dragon healing powers, and further cements her place within the community.A brief note: I was not especially happy with the ending of this story. It is a ""happily for now"", but it does set itself up to lead directly into a new book . . . a continuation of the story. Although not labeled as part of a series, the front cover lists the story as ""Dragon Knights"" - leading me to believe we will encounter this dragon community again, if not these particular characters again. That isn't a bad thing.A nice combination of fantasy and sex, this book is a nice one to pick up and lose yourself in!

It's the first I've read by Bianca D'Arc but based on this I might try more of her work in the future.Bolera is 18 and lives alone with her mother. She's out hunting a deer one day when, right after she shot it in the heart with her arrow, a dragon comes down and takes off with her deer. She chases him and finds where he lands and starts insisting that he give her back the deer. Instead of giving it back, the dragon carries her off...Gareth is a knight and the rider/partner of a dragon. He's surprised to find his dragon, Kelvan, flying in the a young woman along for the ride. Kelvan informs Gareth that she can hear dragon thoughts (a requirement for a mate to a dragon's knight) and leaves her there with Gareth. Gareth feels an attraction to her immediately and seduces her, realizing she's his true mate.Gareth convinces Bolera (and her mother) to come back to the Lair with them for a visit (although he has every intention of convincing her to stay). Because it's a ""mating"" that has a mystical element it's pretty much a ""love at first sight"" for them both and Bolera agrees to be Gareth's wife (aka mate). There are added intricacies that comes with knight/dragon matings that Bolera has to accept. When Bolera and Gareth mate it gives Kelvan the ability to claim his mate (dragon's can't before their knight's have mates because the mating fever would drive the knights mad otherwise). Now that Gareth found Bolera, Kelvan can claim his mate, Rohtina (a female dragon). Rohtina's knight is Lars. By tradition, both knights become husbands to the woman...in this case Bolera. It's actually pretty easy because of the whole mutual mystical attraction thing they have going. Bolera is a bit freaked by the idea of 2 men but is also attracted to both and has a hard time resisting. She does accept them and they merge in to a family (Bolera, Gareth, Lars, Kelvan and Rohtina).There is a bit of an action plot in the story due to an upcoming war with the neighboring country. There are creatures (being sent over b the enemy country) that are causing issues and the dragons have been sent to deal with them. At one point, there's a skirmish with the creatures and Rohtina is badly hurt. Bolera ends up being the one to save her and finds out some interesting possibilities on her origins along with the possibility of finding her lost twin sisters. The story concludes in a nice HEA.This was an enjoyable read. I liked the world and the dragon mythos. It's a cool premise and the rest of the series looks interesting.","08 31, 2013",A10DX94ATZQEFG,"Malinda ""I love books and love to get lost in...",Good dragon rider menage story,1377907200

I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.","02 21, 2014",AR6U5BOVA5PYY,Mishel (P.S.

When the noble dragon, Kelvan, inadvertently enters herlife, Belora's future takes a sharp turn.Because of Belora's ability to communicate with dragons, Kelvanrecognizes her for the special woman that she is.

He has been fightingagainst the evils in his land with Kelvan as his partner, for a longwhile. Upon meeting Belora, Gareth feels instant attraction, and notesthat it is mutual. Because of the shortage of wives for the knights,life in the Border Lair is a far cry from the beliefs with which Belorawas raised. Gareth can only hope that Belora is able to accept thetraditions in the Lair if she recognizes Gareth as her mate.Maiden Flight is a fantasy with a dash of drama and a lot of heat,which completely fascinated me, but not in the way I expected.

617,B000R93D4Y,"[0, 1]",2,"I just can't drag my rating any higher than a 2 star here. I acknowledge that despite my love of dragons and erotica I might not have been the best reader for this book. This is one of those books in which everyone is always spouting off wonderful affirmations and bad things never really happen. Despite the storyline, it's like being stuck in a church van full of kumbaya -singing mormons who only want to help you see how wonderful you really are. The feel-good factor starts to chafe after a while.I think there is a plot that encompasses the whole series (of which there are now 7 books and 3 novellas). It's obvious that war is brewing, royal progeny are going to spring up somewhere, ect. However, there didn't really seemed to be a single plot contained within this book itself, other than lots and lots of sex. Unfortunately I didn't even think all that sex was particularly hot. It lacked details and a lot of it was same-same (for example H1 and H2 never even changed positions).Plus everything moves exceedingly fast. Insta-lust isn't even fast enough to describe it. Within the course of one brief conversation the h and H1 met, fell in love and dispensed with her virginity. Within two days he has asked her to marry him, introduced a third party (H2) to the mix and convinced her to be comfortable with all the other voyeuristic knights. Within a day of that she's rolling with the double penetration, draconic aphrodisiacs and apparently learned to have multiple orgasms a the drop of a freakin' hat with little to no for-play. I know this is erotica. I know I have to suspend my disbelief. I know it's fantasy and all in good fun. But seriously, I could not make myself believe anything could move so quickly.I did like H1 and H2 (H2 probably most of all). I like the mother and Jarred. I liked the dragons. I liked the interesting Wyre life...sorry Lair life. The idea of two men per woman is an interesting one, though male pairing would seem easier. (I don't think I'm the first review to point either aspect out.) I didn't care for the h though. The h, I might point out, who isn't even important enough to have her own name in the book's description, so you can imagine how much effect she has in the book. No, despite liking many of the disparate part of the book I didn't like the book as a whole. Others do. I can't say I cared much for it.","07 10, 2013",AUF0OPKICU6D4,Sadie Forsythe,not for me,1373414400
618,B000R93D4Y,"[11, 12]",3,"Reading the reviews before purchasing this, the first in the series, I was shocked at the negative responses.  I have always enjoyed Bianca's work, so it was out of character to see such reviews.Based on my past experience with her work, combined with my love of dragons, I decided to give the series a shot.  Granted, there is a lot of sex, but this is to be expected for the genre Bianca writes in.  This is an adult romance story & not for kids, which I read as a complaint in a few of the reviews.  How anyone could think otherwise, I have no idea, as it's obvious in the description this book contains sexual situations.Also, many reviewers commented on dragon-human sex.  I did not see this at all, rather the dragons matings affect their human-bonded warriors; I saw nothing untoward about this.  The reviewers made it sound as if the dragons and humans were having sex.  Nothing could be further from the truth.If you know this is an erotic story, with frequent sexual scenes, then you should know what to expect.  As for the story, I found I enjoyed the characters.  The dragons had a surprising amount of humanity, which I enjoyed.  The warriors were strong, capable, sexy men.  There were a lot of sex scenes, no question.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if there was more to the story than sex, as not much occurred beyond their meeting and mating until the very end.Bianca has always had wonderful world and character building, with a great plot.  This story lacked the complexity of her normal writing for me, thus the three star rating.  Other than this, I found the reviews to be unfounded.The best advice I can give regarding this story is, if you have enjoyed this Author's writing, you will likely like this, more for the potential as a continuing series than for this story specifically.  If you have no experience with this Author, I would recommend not judging all of her work based off of this story.  Her work, as a whole is incredible.As an Author myself, I know we don't always hit a home run.  It's not a bad story, it's simply not her best work.  However, I am excited for the future of this series, as I see the potential exists for amazing stories to come.  As I write this review, I believe she is on the seventh book of the series.I would suggest, if it sounds interesting, or like something that may interest you, give it a try.  Do not let the negative reviews alter your opinions of the Author, her work as a whole, or this story in specific.  To do so would be an injustice to a very creative and successful Author.As for me, because I see the potential in the series, I will purchase the next book and see for myself.  I have faith in this Author's writing abilities enough to spend three dollars and change for a chance to see where she takes the series.Also, there were several remarks made of the positive reviews being made all by paid reviewers.  To clarify, as an Author we do not pay reviewers, or pay for reviews.  People who review books are provided with an ARC (advanced reader's copy) so they can read & review prior to publication date.  This is done for many reasons, some being for the benefit of the reader (so they have an opinion to read on a new book), others for the Author (so they can get first-hand feedback early on from people who do nothing but read in their genre).Making an accusation of paying for reviews is harsh, unfounded and discredits the Author, reviewer, and the entire process.  We have no need to pay for reviews, and it would be a vast waste of (what little) resources and time we have.  After all, when the book hits the market, if the reading public does not like it, no amount of positive reviews from reviewers will change this.Also, I would like to point out the fact that most Authors have no say in which reviewers their book is sent to, as this is often a decision made and completely handled by the publisher.  As an Author, I am given so many copies of my book to distribute, but these are used for promotional purposes only (like a contest).  I am not allowed to distribute these books to reviewers.  This is in my contract.  So, to this end, making a claim of paying for reviews again has no foundation.I know this explanation has nothing to do with the story itself, but I felt it necessary to clarify, based off of some (poor) reviews, and their comments.  Especially given, if your profession is not that of an Author, you would likely not know how reviewers are handled.In ending, I'm off to purchase the next in the series; I know Bianca's writing, and I am confident she will take this series in great directions.Enjoy!  =)Shelbie Knightwww.shelbieknight.com","06 11, 2013",A1ZAPFF4YQ4IPJ,"Shelbie Knight ""Shelbie Knight =)""",Make your own decision,1370908800

626,B000R93D4Y,"[18, 18]",4,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora.

But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper. I just wish the story of Angie and Ryan could've happened without the m&eacute;nage with Wade. It just didn't seem necessary and it felt like a dark spot on their beginning.

The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series, I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand, I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha.

The writing is solid, if mildly uninspired, and the scenario could be very interesting, but it's tough to buy the whole 'spy who longs for a normal life falls in love with a grifter with a heart of gold' concept. Perhaps if there'd been more time to develop their relationship...but as it was, they meet, fall in love in day and go off to Switzerland on a ski vakay. Sorry, but that's a tough nut to swallow. We're talking about two people who lie for a living trusting each other implicitly. Yeah, right.As noted, there is a lot of potential for interesting and exotic sequels in this series, and I think anyone interested in the spy/romance genre would probably enjoy 'meeting' these new characters.

659,B000R93DPS,"[1, 1]",5,"Brody, formerly a special ops officer in the Marine Corp, is a 30-something Renaissance Literature professor with a thing for one of the students who just completed this semester's class.  Missy is 26 and working her way through college with dreams of going to medical school.  One night, when her crush, Professor Brody, comes into the adult store where Missy works, a little chit chat leads Brody to volunteer to teach Missy to play poker.  When a few friendly lessons in cards turn into lessons in the bedroom, Missy's inhibitions about her weight threaten to crush their relationship.  Can Brody convince Missy to up the ante and turn this two of a kind into a full house or will Missy fold instead?Do you remember those first few romance novels you read?  If you were at all like me, you snatched them from your mother (or aunt) and alternately grinned and giggled through them.  Part of it was because of the intimacy of the subject matter (even if the books were sedate compared to what you read today) and part of it was reading something maybe you shouldn't have been.  That's exactly what this book was like for me - I found myself grinning and giggling like a happy fool throughout the story.For me, this book had it all... a slightly dangerous, slightly possessive, handsy hero, a mouthy but shy-about-her-weight heroine, a whole lot of sexy banter, sweet but hot monkey love, and a couple of girlfriends (from previous books) that are supportive and maybe a little crazy.  I loved that Brody and Missy have a good time together, whether they're fooling around, fighting, or just having a simple conversation.  Brody is a little unreasonable sometimes, but Missy doesn't just let him run her over - she pushes back.  The back and forth repartee between Brody and his brother is funny and demonstrates their good relationship.Missy is somewhere around a size 16/18 (according to Brody's estimation, though a definitive size is never given for her).  As a result of the encouragement and self-confidence that Brody and her friends help to build up, Missy undergoes a bit of a physical transformation.  I can't explain, as a plus-sized woman, how thrilled I was to watch her change without having to lose weight and to see how well-received it was by her circle of friends.  So many stories about curvy heroines require that she loses weight to finally get the attention/love of the hero.  I was so pleased that Brody helped her to reveal this hidden part of herself while her curves remained unchanged.Since this book is listed as erotica, the story is explicit, but it's the parts outside of the proverbial bedroom that made this book so great to me.  When writing a story, an author can develop characters by telling you what they are like or by showing you.  For example, suppose you have a character that readers should believe is dangerous.  With ""telling"", the author has narrative in the story that basically says the Hero is dangerous - he used to be a Marine, he knows how to fight, etc.  With showing, there's a fight and the Hero takes on five armed men while he only has a broken pool stick.  With ""showing"", you get to experience and see for yourself that the character is who the author wants you to think they are.  It's much easier to tell readers about the hero/heroine, especially in erotica where so many authors think the storyline is just about the sex.  With this story, however, there's a magical balance of telling and showing.  We know Brody wants Missy, but then we get to see it.  He constantly touches her when they're together, he can scan a crowd to find her, he likes to hold her hand, he encourages her to be sexually open with him because he loves her body as is, etc.I've read several of Lena Matthews' books in the past and they're always well written with creative but still sweet love scenes.  This story was probably my favorite of her books and a fantastic value for the current (Kindle) price.  The story is probably a 3 to 4 hour read.  Highly recommended.","11 13, 2011",A88USYRFGDUTK,K.

The point about Brody being upset when Missy would make fun of herself and Brody's refusal to deal with it was mentioned so many times I grew tired of it. And I never really ""got"" why these two people became a couple. This one had less romantic attraction (in the beginning) than the other two in the series--it was more based on sexual attraction.

He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.

And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end. Fortunately, Ms. McKenna does treat us to Christina, Jon and JT's story in her follow up book - THE STRENGTH OF THREE - which is currently available.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 16, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

I usually really like this author and was disappointed by the book because it was just okay.  They story had a very interesting premise, but it was not fleshed out into the full story it deserved.  The shortness of the story makes Aislinn's capitulation a little too quick even though you know they have been working together for 6 months already. I would love to see this story worked out into a full novel by this author and see where it really goes.

681,B000R93E3E,"[14, 16]",5,"With an abusive ex-husband stalking her relentlessly, Aislinn has had to keep moving in order to stay out of his clutches.  She never stays in one town more than one month, remaining as unattached as possible so that leaving is easier to bear.  But when she takes a job at Turner Industries, staying isolated proves impossible as she finds herself irresistibly drawn to her employer, Kyle Turner III.  Still, she avoids becoming involved with him past their working relationship - that is, until her clairvoyant abilities show her a fatal vision involving Kyle!Kyle knows all about Aislinn's past, in minute detail.  Being ex-Special Forces and in the security industry, it is his business to know everything about the people close to him - especially pretty little personal assistants who distract him like no other woman can.  He has no intention of letting Aislinn run again, not when he can protect her from her past and keep her close to him, where she belongs...I do not think Annmarie McKenna can do wrong with a story.  I have loved every piece of her work I have read so far!  Two Sighted was a pleasure both to read and to write a review for.  It is books like this that make my job simple, and I wish they could all be this good.Kyle Turner III pushed every button I have, proving that this author knows just what women love in their heroes.  In fact, if you could place orders for men that would exactly suit your needs, I would want McKenna's help placing the order since she seems to know what I want better than I do myself!  Kyle is the epitome of the overprotective Alpha male who pursues the woman he loves with an unwavering focus and a sensitivity that belies his `he-man' status.Aislinn's fear and loneliness are palpable as she longs for those simple human comforts long denied her - a best friend, a phone call with her mother, a man to fall in love with, a home that is hers for longer than 8 months.  Yet even in her determination to remain detached, we see that she can't help but care about those around her.  While her abusive ex-husband may have stolen her sense of belonging, her hopes for a future, he hasn't robbed her of her empathy.  While it might be easy to be jealous of the woman who captures the attentions of the hunky Kyle, no one could begrudge Aislinn for stealing his heart.I was impressed with Annmarie McKenna's very first novel,Blackmailed, and my admiration for her work grows with each new release.  In Two Sighted, she effortlessly sets the stage for a sequel starring several of the supporting leaving her fans aching for it without leaving this book feeling unfinished in any way.  I know I will be hungrily snapping up any new releases both in this series and from this author!","12 1, 2007",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1196467200

Will Dolan make his move on Cait? Will Cait's father make her choose between the life she's always known and the future she could have with Cord?Take Me is the first story I've read by Mackenzie McKade and it won't be my last!  Cait is a character I would love to be friends with and who wouldn't want to spend a night in the arms of Cord and Dolan?  What impressed me most about Take Me (besides the sexy cowboys) is the natural emotional complications which arose after the trio's passionate encounter.  I dreamily sighed over Cord's possessiveness and I admired how Ms. McKade handled Dolan's attraction to Cait.  In the hands of another author, Dolan's desire to start a relationship with Cait might have annoyed me or detracted from the tale.  However, this is not the case; Ms. McKade deftly handles the emotions of all involved and I was more than happy with the story's ending.  Take Me is an engaging read, filled with likeable characters and deliciously hot love scenes.  Sinful, yet satisfying, I greatly enjoyed Ms. McKade's book.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","01 4, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Take Me,1262563200

741,B000SWV6HG,"[12, 14]",4,"I was so excited to read the series of the Buckhorn brothers after seeing what great reviews it got and since I liked one of Foster's other books I bought the bundle.The first story in the series is about Sawyer, the oldest brother.  He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.The second story is about Morgan, the second brother.  He's the hunky Sheriff.  In his story he fights the urges to become involved with Misty, Honey's sister.  His story was much better to me than Sawyers.  I was more interested in it and Morgan didn't switch as much in personality.  However, he did mess with Misty's car when she wanted to leave and I didn't really like that he did that.  Seemed juvenile.  His scowling got old after a while, but that was just his personality.  He acted tough, but he was a big softy.  Overall it was a decent story.Gabe's story is third, but he's the youngest brother.  He's the sexy, layback, fun loving brother.  His story was great.  He meets Elizabeth who is the complete opposite of Gabe.  She's prissy, a bookworm, inexperienced, and nave.  Gabe and her clash during the book, but also have a big attraction to one another.  Gabe takes it upon himself to show Elizabeth how to have some fun in life.  This story was a little different than the other two since Elizabeth is different from Honey and Misty.  It was a fun, sexy story that showed how opposites attract.Jordan, the third brother, was the last story.  He's the sexy, calm, vet.  His story was slightly different from the rest.  He meets Georgia, who is a dancer at a bar, divorced, takes care of her mother, and had two children.  Sparks fly right away between them.  Despite Jordan not liking Georgia being a dancer, he never tried to force her to quit and accepted her for who she was and what she had to do to take care of her kids.  I was worried his story was going to be short and he was a great guy so I was glad his story turned out to be complete.  His book was probably my second favorite after Gabe's.Casey, Sawyer son, was also more involved in this story and there's one he's in called Enticing.Overall the series started out a little rocky, but ended up great.  All four brothers have great qualities about them and some flaws.  At times in any of the stories things became predictable.  Also it seemed like every brother fell instantly in love with the woman in their story.  There wasn't a lot of leading up to them realizing they had feelings, it happened right away every time.  But in the end, you can't help but fall in love with each of them.","01 26, 2011",A1DX8P31MBC2PE,JJ,"Started rocky, ended great",1296000000

744,B000SWV6HG,"[1, 1]",4,"This romance book bundles the stories of heroes Sawyer, Morgan, Gabe and Jordan, 4 brothers who live together in their childhood home. Sawyer is the doctor, Morgan is the sheriff, Gabe is the laid back handyman and Jordan is the vet. Each man is in some way the pillar of their small town community, and other than being womanizers (in a nice and respectful way), they are all perfect. For that I gave a 1 star deduction. One decent, halo-over-his-head glowing, handsome, tall, muscular, sexy, honest, single, well-endowed, straight brother is amazing, two is shocking, three is a stretch, and four is defying the laws of possibility.Other than that each story was funny, sweet, and thoroughly enjoyable.Sawyer is a divorced, single father of a teenage son who runs his medical practice from his home and does housecalls. He meets Honey when she loses control of her car and crashes into his fence. Turns out she's suffering from pneumonia but is running from someone who's out to get her. Sawyer shelters her and takes care of her and in the course of that they fall in love.Morgan is single, large and a temper to match. At least he only pretends to have a temper. His bark is worse than his bite, but everyone is so afraid of him that his scowl is enough to keep miscreants out of his town and everyone else on their best behavior. Misty, Honey's sister, enters the picture when she shows up to help Honey prepare for the wedding. Morgan takes an instant dislike to her, a dislike which is only amplified by his attraction to her. He thinks she's too seductive and flirtatious and a walking billboard for trouble. What's more, Misty is broke, unemployed, and pregnant. Wrongly accused of stealing and had arrested and charged by her boss, then abandoned by her boyfriend when she announced her pregnancy. After learning of her situation, Morgan does a 180 on his opinion of her and works to clear her name.Gabe is the town's handyman extraordinaire. He meets Lizzy, a redhead he doesn't find particularly attractive at first, when she comes to interview him for a paper she's writing on people who have performed heroic acts. Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother, but she has serious self-confidence issues. This is a true story of opposites attract. Gabe is as laid back as can be, who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself. He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility. Lizzy is as uptight as one can get, freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun, and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.Jordan is the vet with the golden voice. Georgia is a single mother of two who works as a dancer/waitress to provide for her children and ailing mother. Burnt badly by her ex-husband, she doesn't trust men and doesn't know what to make of 4 men who seem to spend their lives bending over backwards to help others. Especially Jordan, who is great with her children and who has her mother eating out of his hand. Of all the books, this one is the funniest. Jordan's reaction to seeing Georgia dance in a skimpy outfit was priceless. However, of all the books, this one focuses too much on the other secondary characters. Between the romance brewing between Georgia's mother and Misty & Honey's father, and Sawyer's son, I felt a bit shortchanged on the main characters love story.What I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable. So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male, testosterone laden, treat the women like doormats heroes, it's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive. All the women had spunk which is something I also like. They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.Likable characters and cute stories.

Esme is desperately trying to escape her abusie father and marriage to an old and rather sinister man. She throws herself at St John to escape. The plot follows their romance. I found this well written but it failed to make magic for me. Perhaps this was partly because St John was not so likeable in the first book which I read quite recently and therefore could not make the switch to like him. Perhaps it was Esme who just kept throwing herself at him and despite several attempts to get close which failed, still did not really appear to be looking at alternatives seriously to escape what awaited her where she to return home. I cannot say this is bad, the 3 rating is based solely on my gut reaction and the lack of chemistry I felt.

Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war, he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation (plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he'll be an Earl due to an inheritance). So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father, he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children. They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness (Yea, I wasnt buying that). During the next few weeks, St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home. I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away (but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero's protest, at some point you need to get some back bone. Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father. And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste. I skimmed alot so I cannot in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset.

After leaving with the emerald necklace the Duchess gave him, he had joined the army and served with distinction.  After he leaves the army, he must live one year scandal free if he wants a reward offered to him by the Prince Regent.Esme Danville lives with her abusive father who wants to marry her off to a man his age, if not older and just as abusive. Seeing no way out, she decides to become someone's mistress and thus get the marriage called off.  After seeing St. John breaking up with his mistress without laying a hand on her, she decides he is the one she wants.  After hearing her outlandish and most unladylike proposal, he refuses and ends up taking her to his brother's house, a place he is not welcome.  They do agree that they may stay under certain conditions.  The duchess tries to introduce her to eligible men without success.  Esme only has eyes for St. John who is trying to live down his infamous and deal with an addiction to laudanum he uses to deal with wartime memories.  It is hard to ignore Esme and his resolve slowly starts to crumble.After their inevitable return to London, Esme has to endure abuse from her father and despairs of not seeing St. John again.  He does get the reward and faces one challenge after another to  rescue her and get their happily ever after.Because I always wanted to know what happened to him after the end of the first book, I went ahead and bought this one.I think it is good and it kept my attention, something not all Regencies do.  I do recommend it to others who read the first book not only because of  St. John, but also shows how the people in the first book have prospered.  I do suggest they read the books in order as events in the first book are mentioned more than once.","06 14, 2014",A2Z0JW8EQ2EBIZ,Mary Kay McConnell,An Unladylike Offer,1402704000

771,B000U0NSV8,"[2, 2]",4,"My Favorite of the series.  It is the story of Esme Canville and St John Radwell.  St John was the villain in the first book of the series, The Inconvenient Duchess.  In the years since the last novel, St John has transformed himself and is in the process of making himself into a respectable person.  Esme, however, is looking for the villain.  In order to avoid the arranged marriage her father has planned for her, Esme seeks St john to compromise her.  St John, however, delivers her to his brother (with whom he continues to have a strained relationship).  As could be expected, however, Esme and St John become involved in a relationship.I enjoyed this book because of the character of St john.  I really disliked him in the first book and almost stopped reading the book because of him.  However, he has completely redeemed himself and I was deeply interested in how he has remade himself but still has to deal with his past.

Caleb McCurdy has just been released from a five year stint in a Yuma prison. He'd taken the fall for his outlaw brothers who'd tried to rob the bank and left him holding the horses. He'd paid for his participation, but his soul is tormented by the deeds of his brothers at the Shafton Ranch. Caleb owed a debt to the widow Shafton for the killing of her husband, something he had tried to stop. Laura Shafton remembers that evil day five years before in her nightmares. She'd lost her husband but she had her son, Robbie; the unborn child she'd been carrying. She's wary of strangers, so when Caleb knocks on her door to offer work for food, she greets him with a shotgun. While Caleb is mending her gate, Robbie seems to disappear, only to be found hiding in a tree. On his way down the boy falls breaking his arm, and Caleb helps Laura set the break and splint it. This builds a certain amount of wary trust in Laura and she allows Caleb to stay in her tool shed and continue to work for food. Caleb fears that at any time Laura's going to recognize him as the 17 year old who had accompanied those evil men, but he's matured a lot since then and his body has grown strong. Laura too is no longer the teenage bride; she's now a strong independent woman. Their attraction is something that Caleb fights; for he knows that should Laura ever find out who his is she'll never forgive him.I really liked the plot for this story. The characters are very well developed and easy to like. Though both Laura and Caleb are in their early 20's in this book, they've both lived a life time in experiences. Caleb has always been a good man, but he'd been misguided by his need for family, and so he'd stuck with his brothers. Laura is incredibly strong and resilient, almost over the top so. She'll survive anything in order to protect and care for her son.

When a person is forced to grow up faster, than they should for their age and face reality that is exactly what Laura and Caleb did. Caleb was an okay hero. What I disliked about him was that had been with whores. That is just disgusting on so many levels. I get that in romance novels guys aren't suppose to be virgins and women have to be virgins or have been with a least one man, but sleeping with whores takes it to another level. What I did like abut him is that protected Laura and her son, Robbie. Would I recommend his book to anyone? No. Would I read it again? No. It is an okay book to read if you 're bored. I would recommend that anyone who wants to read it should get loaned from a friend or something before buying it. Or else you will be like me who bought and did not like.

I didn't like the idea of the hero deceiving the heroine but he grew on me and so did this story.5 years ago, Caleb and his half brothers pass the Shafton farm house and ask for a meal. Laura Shafton's naive husband welcomes the strangers with open arms and soon the unthinkable happens when one the brothers attempts to rape the pregnant Laura her. Caleb tries to stop his brother but Laura's trauma over the attempted attack and the murder of her husband has her implementing all of the brothers in the crimes including Caleb. The 3 brothers leave and Laura is left scarred, traumatized and a widow with a baby on the way.Fast forward 5 years later. After being released from prison (being the caught scapegoat while his brothers get away), Caleb still remembers the pretty Laura Shafton and what happened at that ranch. He passes by wondering if she's okay and what happened to her. When he gets there he finds Laura and her 4 year old son and seeing her scarred face and haunted eyes brings back the memories. To absolve himself for even being there, he offers to help her around her ranch. She cautiously takes the stranger's offer and soon finds herself befriending the mysterious and rugged Caleb while her son falls in love with having a male figure around.I was really surprised to find myself actually liking this story. Laura is such a strong heroine. You'll cry for all she's lost in family, raising her son alone and losing her confidence in showing her face in town embarrassed by her scarred face. How she survived her ordeal and kept on moving makes her a heroine to love. Caleb is a hero you sympathize with. As a half breed (American/Native American), you feel for him wanting to be around his brothers and accepted but realizing how evil they are and trying to fully break free from their holds even when they're not around.I enjoyed Caleb and Laura separated and definitely together and her son is adorable and his relationship with Caleb and Caleb's ""fatherly"" patience with him made me like Caleb even more.Overall: I'd definitely pick this one up if I were you.

Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blond bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.Across the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.Lucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to dye her hair. Blond was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.Today Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.What started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.Though I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.What really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.Unfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me.Strange Bedpersons- 3 StarsOriginally published in 1994, there's little about this quirky romance about the ladder-climbing yuppie Republican lawyer Nick and the hippie, commune-raised, militant-feminist liberal Tess that doesn't feel almost painfully dated. That being said, Crusie pens a fast-paced plot that delves more deeply than I'd anticipated into the potential disaster of a relationship between two people who love each other, but who are so different they will never see eye to eye.Nick, despite his career-loving little heart, is a fun character who is actually pretty forgiving and able to compromise, though he does have a rather vanilla predilection for sex in bed. He's pretty darn forgiving of some pretty radical behavior and recognizes before Tess does that some compromise is in order, yet he still manages to mess up a little as he presses his own sense of fashion off onto the bohemian Tess and tries to wear down some of her rougher edges before he realizes that he's got to decide to accept her as is or lose her. I found Tess harder to like, though I did respect her commitment to her values. Still, her uncompromising attitude and selfish judgments of those who don't share her militant views were off-putting through most of the book.Strange Bedpersons started abruptly, too abruptly, with Nick banging on Tess' door and Tess closing it in his face, the two of them obviously already sharing a history. It took a little while to get the story on their history, so the opening of the book seemed jarring and left me feeling like I missed something. It made it hard to get into and I had to struggle a bit to 'catch up.' That did subside a bit as the story progressed, though the other issues - the dated feeling and my issues with Tess - didn't. Still, I can't argue Crusie's ability to nail witty, fast-moving dialogue and touch on human truisms with humor and intelligence. I just wish that prior to republication, this story had gone through a bit of a brush up to make it more socially and culturally timely and not quite so anachronistic to contemporary romance.What the Lady Wants- 4 StarsMitchell Peatwick Kincaid is a stockbroker, but a fondness for Sam Spade and a mild feeling of discontent with his job convinced him to get a private investigator license, and about a year ago, a bet with his boss and some friends - and a lot of alcohol - goaded him into leaving his prosperous career with his prestigious firm, putting the stuff from his monied life into storage, and taking on private detecting as a career under the name Mitchell Peatwick. And if he can get his private investigation firm into the black in a year, he'll win that $10,000 bet.Twelve months of private investigating, however, taught Mitch two things: everybody lies, and real life private investigation work doesn't resemble anything remotely similar to Sam Spade's life. Until SHE walked in.SHE is Mae Belle Sullivan and she's looking for a PI who isn't all that bright so she can lie to him.

Answers that will save Mae from financial ruin and explain what her reprehensible old fart of a relative was doing with all the art and keepsakes that have been disappearing from his house for the past few months. An overheard conversation pointed her in the direction of her uncle's journal, but it's been missing since he died and Mae's starting to get frantic to find it. So she lies. And she uses her feminine wiles. And she pays Mitch Peatwick just about everything in her bank account to investigate the murder of her uncle. Who was in his seventies, had a heart condition and a twenty-five year old mistress, and died in her bed. Mae's fairly certain it wasn't murder.Mitch knows he's being lied to by the delicious-looking Mae Belle, but her retainer pushes him into the black and secures his bet...and anything is better than trailing cheating spouses, so he takes her case. There are just a couple of problems for them both. Mitch isn't anywhere near as slow as Mae had hoped, and as more and more clues start to pile up, her uncle's death starts to look more and more like an actual murder - even to Mae.With a quirky cast of primary and secondary characters and a twisting, rollicking plot that includes suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy, What the Lady Wants delivers a lot of charm and a few good hours of light entertainment. Originally published in 1995, the story is a little worn around the edges and has a bit of a dated patina to it, but not so much that it detracts from the story as in some of Crusie's books. It's more like a faint scent on the air than a bat upside the head. Noticeable, but not painful.Mitch is a fun character, and quicker than he looks. Which is probably a good thing. I'm dating myself here, but he reminded me a lot of Magnum PI or Rick Simon from Simon & Simon - a bit cynical about life, a bit sloppy on the outside but sharp and thorough when he needed to be. Mae was endearing. Intelligent and kind, with a streak of independence a mile wide and a determination that is formidable. She's a bit stubborn when she needs to be, but not so cold as to be unappealing as a person. She cares about the people she loves and takes on the responsibility of caring for them, as needed. Together they made a good couple, and their banter was one of the high points of the book.Crusie excels at quickly paced plots with quirky characters and a lot of witty, intelligent, and sarcastic banter. It's what keeps me coming back to her when I want or need some brain candy. I'd love to see this story get a bit of a modernized polish to clear away the dated patina, but even as it stands, I liked it quite a bit.Charlie All Night- 3.5 StarsWhen you're the go-to girl at the radio station and you're producing the number one drive time show in the area, you've got a lot of responsibility and your future is looking bright. When the talent of that show dumps you, then two months later fires you from the show, you're bright future starts to look more like flames from a crash and burn. Allie McGuffey is feeling the heat from those flames after her radio personality ex-boyfriend Mark dumps her as producer and the station puts her on a new overnight time slot. Pushed from drive time to overnight is humiliating. Pushed there by her ex-boyfriend with his supercilious attitude and delusions of competency is even worse.Putting on a good face just leads to another crisis as a mad dash to the nearest bar/restaurant with her ex hot on her heels forces Allie into uncharted waters. She picks up the first non-suit wearing male she can find and desperately tries to act like she's perfectly okay while her insides are still quaking. Though the rugged man she clings to is obviously surprised by her blatant come on, he doesn't sell her out, which makes him a hero in Allie's book.Charlie Tenniel is a bit of a bounce around. He doesn't stay in one place too long, doesn't limit himself to doing one thing for his life, either. His wanderlust is a constant disappointment for his socially formidable father. His brother, radio personality Ten Tenniel, was more the man his father wanted him to be, but look where that got him - a drug habit and escape from prosecution courtesy of their father's connections. Charlie wasn't going to go out like that. He was, however, going to take the job his father wanted him to take as a favor to the station owner, an old family friend. An anonymous tip claims knowledge of a drug ring opperating from the station and Charlie's been conscripted to chase down the responsible party. He just wants to fly under the radar for the six weeks or so he plans to stay in town, so having Allie pressed up against him is just fine, but when he realizes she's his new producer and intends to make him a star, he's just as adamant that she doesn't.His position would probably be a lot stronger if he could just stay out of her bed.While the premise of Charlie All Night is a bit of a stretch and the actions of Allie and Charlie seem more than a little irresponsible both sexually and professionally, I can't argue that the story itself is light, fun entertainment with plenty of endearing moments. I enjoyed the banter and romantic development between Allie and Charlie. Crusie does banter and endearing really well and it's definitely in evidence here. There's not much to the plot, though, and with an original publication date of 1996, there's a dated feel to both the technology and equipment described in the station and a definite pre-Monica Lewinsky air of sexual permissiveness in the work place that didn't translate well for me.So long as you don't take the book too seriously, or expect much in the way of depth of plot or character, there's still a lot of entertainment to be had from the story of Charlie and Allie, two people who won't be poster children for sexual harassment litigation any time soon, but who still managed to make me chuckle.Originally reviewed by title for One Good Book Deserves Another.","09 5, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Humor But Little 'Contemporary' Romance,1283644800

820,B000UMZMP6,"[2, 2]",4,"This story has several themes I personally really enjoy in erotica or erotic romance: full-figured heroine, military hero, interracial relationship, and an element of coercion. Although the coercion is a small part of the story, and I wouldn't characterize it as hardcore or full-on, it is still there for me to enjoy. Now, I know this idea of coercion doesn't work for everyone, but Abby's seeking to appease Mason with her body was very hot to me.Plus, she really wasn't doing something she didn't want to do. She'd been resisting Mason for weeks, denying him at every turn, and I think this was a convenient reason for her to give in to her attraction to Mason. For his part, he sees this as an opportunity to force her to spend some time with him and to take a chance on him. And how she resisted this man for a month, I just do not know. A military alpha with that commanding presence, muscular body, beautiful brown skin, sexy bedroom eyes, and a total good guy all the way around-- What was the girl thinking?Abby does have her reasons for resisting him, and as she and Mason spend the weekend together, stronger feelings other than lust develop. This story isn't long; it's actually around 58 pages. There is lots of sex, but it's done the way I love sex to be done: super hot, well-written, with the sexy edge of an in-charge man, and with a very sweet emotional connection between h/H. While there is no 'I love you' moment, I definitely felt HEA was in store for this couple. I thought it was a hot read with one very yummy hero who was tired of taking 'No' for an answer. There's no way Abby's getting away from him now.","09 1, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S. Richards,Trusting Mason,1314835200

They had met at a rodeo where Rafe was riding a huge bull and dry humped in a barn later.  Cathy was letting down her hair by going to the rodeo instead of sipping champagne at the country club before heading back to Boston to take  her place as an  attorney  in family tradition and never regretted their love making until she went home and he never called,  Then one day he was on her door step and her heart bounded in her chest as she invited him in for a drink where he proposed and she accepted.  It had been four years ago and most of last year they rarely saw each other, he treated her like fragile porcelin instead of a wife; it was moneey from her trust fund that saved the ranch and her salary that kept them in the black yet her name was not on the deed!The moment Rafe sat atop the bull and glanced at the pretty woman with clothes so new they screamed designer he was hooked and when she smiled he was a goner!  Seven seconds later he was thrown but he did not care because he had to meet this woman!  Looking back, the sex was amazing but when she got hired by the county she stayed away longer and longer and he knew she wanted him to do some thing but for the life of him he did not know what! Standing there watching her go he choked on the lump in his throat knowing she took his heart with her.Dee S. Knight pens one terrific read that will make you shed tears, squirm, and be glued to your seat at the same time as you rapidly read!

Will these two who obviously love each other find a way to salvage their marriage and start to trust in one another?Second Wind is a very good story.  Communication and trust is the key to a solid relationship.  Rafe and Cathy had neither of these and to add to their problems, their jobs didn't leave them with much one on one time.  Cathy did well by Rafe, and honestly she gave a whole lot more than she got from him.  Rafe wasn't a bad person he just wasn't on Cathy's level, but opposites do attract and that was definitely demonstrated here.  What they lacked in other aspects of their marriage they compensated with the strong passion they had for each other.  They were hot together but need to work on life outside the bedroom.

I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong. Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck. I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry.

It's his willingness, even when he's not sure of it, to step out of his comfort space that I liked. There's a very touching moment when he struggles with what he wants from Jeff. I loved that scene, even though it broke my heart.Jeff is hard to understand. He's got a lot going on and a lot to hide. But it's believable. He can't lose his daughter, but he can't seem to let go of Ryan. That sort of conundrum is a good one to have in some ways. Ryan's a hunky catch. Anna, Jeff's daughter, adds a cute and heartwarming touch. She's smitten with Ryan and totally in favor of her daddy being happy. If only all people could be that understanding...If you want a story that's hot and has a sizzling scene in a Camaro (my vehicular weapon of choice), then you need to read Custom Ride.

Lucia is a commoner who is working as a serving maid at a local tavern. Lucia has been trying to help a dragon (Sir Reynor) who is hurtand ill, but her skills are not up to the job. She finally goes to the castle to get help from a healer and is immediately involvedwith the dragon's knight Sir Marcus and his partner Sir Kaden, Reynor's mate.Lucia is a from the country of Helios, raised by the Jinn, she does not have a commoner background, she has a limited healing ability and is not afraid of dragons. Sir Marcus is totally captivated by her and his partner is also attracted in spite of his feelingsof guilt about Reynor's injury. The three can become a family, if Reynor can be healed and is able to fly again. Learning about Lucia's background and why she doesn't act the part of a serving maid becomes part of her attraction to the two knights.This story was listed as number 4.5 in the series and was only $2.66.

No matter, she was just determined to save her dying friend, the dragon Reynor, and to do that she must engage the help of his Knight, Sir Kaden, or his love, the dragoness Linea.A waitress in a simple pub, Lucia certainly never expected to return to the tavern with two dragons, two Knights, and the Queen of Draconia herself in tow!  But it is just this troupe of heroes that arrive in time to help Reynor, for it is not just his body that is withering, but his spirit as well.It soon becomes clear to Knights Kaden and Marcus that Lucia is their mate, fated to complete the union between dragons and knights and round out their family.  But Lucia isn't from Draconia, and while she has heard rumor of the strange custom in which two Dragon Knights must marry one woman, she is uncertain she can go through with it...If you have read many of my reviews, it is no secret to you that I am a huge fan of author Bianca D'Arc, and most especially her Dragon Knights stories.  You can imagine my pleasure that she continues to imagine new stories for this fascinating series, and that she seems to have no trouble finding ways to keep the stories fresh and exciting, as proven once more with the newest edition in the saga, Wings of Change.With this new story, we enjoy a return to the m&eacute;nage theme that began the series.  This scenario guarantees some built-in angst for the story as Lucia tries to come to terms with the idea of mating with two men, a situation beyond her experience or the societal norms of her own country.  But Kaden and Marcus are more than up to the task of convincing her that their love is true and right, with a little help from Marcus' dragoness, the Lady Linea.Of course, the relationship between these three isn't the sole focus of D'arc's book - she fleshes it out nicely with some long-hidden secrets about Lucia, some of which she herself is hiding, and a few of which have been long hidden from her.  As we learn Lucia's secrets, we see that she may very well be a most important figure in the future of the war between Draconia and Sskithdron.The author introduces us to yet another most intriguing new species, something I believe I'm becoming rather spoiled on!  As a long-time lover of Fantasy stories, my excitement with the introduction of each new creature builds more and more, expanding not only the horizons within this world, but my interest as well.Wings of Change is the fifth story in the Dragon Knights series, and will be released in print in the future anthology, I Dream of Dragons I.  While this book can be read as a standalone without leaving the reader confused, the story will be best enjoyed if you read the entire series in order.

She wakes up in a motel room the next day with a concussion.  Mac is with her.  He was recently hired to work with her on the horse farm.  Together they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about it.  Maris has no memory of what she was doing before she was injured.  Maris realizes she is attracted to Mac.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was about half the length of a typical romance novel.  It was a ""falling in lust"" story.  There was no time for any relationship development.  It was shallow.  I wanted more intrique, unique characters, and more interesting plot and dialogue.  But if you loved the series, you might like this out of curiosity.After the mystery and danger is over, a chunk of time is spent with Maris' family in Wyoming.  There is the cute little toddler, all the hunky men, their wives and children.  Everyone is loving and protective.  It was a pleasant time.OTHER BOOKS:There are five Mackenzie books.  The first three were much better than books 4 and 5.  This is book 4.  For a list of my reviews of all five books, see my 5 star review of Burn posted 7-11-09.CAUTION SPOILER:I didn't understand the scene in which Maris was hit in the head (which was told and not shown).  Apparently the bad guy was starting to inject the horse when Maris arrived.  He hits her in the head causing a concussion, but she is able to get on the horse and ride away.  Can one be concussed and still mount and ride?  Why couldn't the bad guy finish the injection as she was mounting?  I wanted more details and showing, not telling.DATA:Kindle count story length: 1462.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 1, about a page long.

Certainly not all gay men, or even all ""bottoms.""  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical?

The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature.

He's sizing up the local werewolf pack, introducing himself so he can scope out the feasibility of moving here. What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack.

The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.I heartily recommend it, and especially recommend ""Without Reservations"" and ""With Caution"" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations).

It made for a good attention grabber.  Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.Dev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.When Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.

The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.It is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.It was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.","11 9, 2012",A3MT311233OHMQ,"Sophia Rose ""Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...",Quick Fun Read That Jumps Right in With the Plot and Romance,1352419200

The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden.

Putting a book as a freebie draws in those with no interest in the genre.All that said, the demon tale is one I would choose to read from a favorite author, as I am a fan of horror and supernatural fiction, so I reserve the right to be a tad critical. The set up of the story (the pre-prologue, if you like) was great. It tells the history of the demons, how they came to be. It was well written, interesting & gave me hope that it would be a great book.  As another reviewer stated though, the actual prologue was rather cliche-ridden with Gage and his ""lethal charm"" and Jordan resisting at every turn until she melted into his kisses. But I pushed on....As we know from the pre-prologue, Shadow Demons roam the earth. They are evil, they feed on emotion. Jordan, our heroine, is a vigilante destroyer: cop by day, demon slayer by night, after she witnessed the brutal murder of her partner and lover at the sword of a Shadow Demon.The storyline itself isn't bad, but it does lack development of the characters. Other than Jordan being stubborn and feisty, there's not much else that we learn about her. The twist in the tale isn't shocking - not because I expected it (I didn't at all) but because we didn't get to know enough about any of the other characters to really care, and so when the twist was revealed, it gave me more of a ""oh"" reaction than a ""WOW! I never would have guessed"" shocker.My title calls this repetitive, and it does become so. The same fight scenes replay, but worse - the same sex scene is basically repeated over and over. I think even those readers who love a racy sex scene would be disappointed. By the 3rd replay, I skipped them altogether. Nothing new here.","11 7, 2009",A3JR6D5B9WF5J8,Danielle,Repetitive story line,1257552000

I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you like the fantasy or urban fantasy type novels, I think you might like this one.  Be aware that this book has some rather racy bits in it, so I don't think kids should probably read it.  The only problem with this book for me is that it has no chapter demarcations.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how far along a person is in a book and how close a person is to the end of a chapter when he/she needs to find a stopping place at times.  Give it a shot because it might be just a bit of escapist fun for a while.  Have at it!

The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future, Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper.

The first book I ever read to make a vampire the romantic lead, you kicked off a genre that has exploded and will not be stopped.  Truly groundbreaking, I thank you so much for leading the way and clearing a path for more.If you haven't read these books, DO SO NOW!A human can only become a vampire if they contain a rare blood antigen, and each vampire has one human with the antigen (a chosen) whom they feel drawn to protect.  A government agency, DPI (department of paranormal investigations), is out to capture and make lab rats out of every vampire possible and they're not above using The Chosen to do it.  And if they can't capture, they don't hesitate to kill.With this series, you get a complete story of two characters in each book, but we still get to reacquaint ourselves with some of our favorites along the way.Having read these books as a teenager, I was hesitant to reread them as an adult.  So many books that I loved back then fail to resonate with me now.  Wings in the night did not disappoint and I was enthralled once again.I truly believe that without this series, we would have no Twilight, no Midnight Breed, and no Blackdagger Brotherhood.  I'm not saying Wings In The Night inspired those books, I'm saying Wings In The Night created the genre and made it popular.","04 12, 2014",A1LWBT4OIUF49X,avidreader,"These books were the start of my obsession with ""good"" vampires.",1397260800

The other thing, I'm not sure how to put into words, but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example, Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this.

972,B000XZKZKM,"[3, 3]",5,"Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

Vowing at the tender age of five to marry him, she has had to live with the ridicule of that one statement until she has hardened her heart against Rafe.  When she finds out that her father has given his permission and signed a marriage contract between she and Rafe, Emma is hurt and angry.  She knows that deep down a man life Rafe could never love a woman like her so she sets out to negotiate her own marriage terms.Rafe Sinclair can't believe his grandfather put a stipulation to his inheritance.  If he doesn't marry by his birthday, the ranch on which he lives will no longer be his.  Having no choice but to find a wife, Rafe doesn't look forward to the politics that go along with wife hunting.  However, his problem is solved when Emma Radcliff's father and he agree on his marrying Emma.  Now if he can just get Emma to agree, his inheritance will be safe and Rafe will have a wife.Emma and Rafe have to learn to be a team.  Each is cantankerous in their own way, Emma more so in my opinion than Rafe.  She was so angry at times that even I winced at her displeasure.  I thought Rafe was loyal and hero worthy.  He was patient and kind to Emma and I wished more than once that she was a bit softer for this sexy virile man.  Beth Williamson came through for me with Emma's characterization because by the time I read the last word and closed Branded, I knew without a doubt that Emma was meant for Rafe and vice versa.Beth Williamson never fails to deliver a book that will keep me entertained and on the edge of my seat.  Her storyline of Branded was unique and I loved how it ended.  Nobody writes western historical romances like Beth Williamson and I am proud to be one of her biggest fans.","02 8, 2008",A1PW5SQLR0Z6IH,"Natalie S ""ns65""",Joyfully Reviewed!,1202428800

He loved her but did not know it, did not even know what love was...literally had no idea, and she loved him even when she did not want to. She left for about 5 months before he found her again. She was 8 months or so pregnant and the baby was 4 months old when he caught up to them. The heroine takes things for granted and should have talked to the hero when his assistant told her they were sleeping together, but she had insecurities that all pregnant women have and thought he wanted someone else. They were faithful during their time apart, which is always a plus to me. My favorite part is when she told him about how she had been proposed to before and that the waiter was going to propose tonight (to his own g/f, but she leaves that out to the hero) and he gets up and leaves, doesn't say anything, and comes back 30 minutes later with a ring.

There were some misunderstandings, that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone, and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story, because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin, a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart, as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture.

This time it's Ross Benson's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.Ross Benson is wealthy, titled, and thoroughly enjoys the London social scene and all that it entails.  He's earned a reputation among the women and has been very careful to avoid interacting with marriage minded young women and innocents.  The last thing he intends to happen is to seduce the sister of his best friend Timothy.Cassandra Rollins far prefers life in the country.  She detests crowds, couldn't care less about fashions, and has no interest in any of the things that most women covet.  She's a true bluestocking and thrives on furthering her knowledge of the world about her through her love of books.  The only trait that she shares with the shallow society women is her adoration of Ross.Cassandra's sleep is interrupted by the return of her brother and Ross's voices singing bawdy songs that certainly weren't meant for a lady to hear.  The men are obviously inebriated but she doesn't grow concerned until the singing stops and she hears a thud and a low curse.  When she opens the door to check on them, Timothy is passed out in a sitting position outside his own bedroom with Ross trying unsuccessfully to rouse him.  They manage to get Timothy to his bed and then Ross admits that he can't remember which guest room is his.  Cassandra makes the offer to escort him to his room so that he doesn't end up climbing into bed with her very formidable aunt.  From a maidenly point of view, that offer of assistance may turn out to be a mistake.  As she's getting ready to leave him to ready himself for bed, Ross requests that she kiss him good night and she finds that she can't deny him the request and soon doesn't want to deny him or the pleasures that they'll both find in his bed.  Will they come to regret the results of their reckless moment?IN A RECKLESS MOMENT is the third book in Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This storyline is full of all the loveable characters, passion and suspense that I've come to eagerly anticipate about this series.  I adored Cassandra because she is so different from society ladies.  She's extremely intelligent and honest, not to mention beautiful.  With the combination of those traits she manages to snare Ross's affection and keep him firmly enthralled with her.  Ross has been living the `privileged' lifestyle for so long he doesn't even see how self-indulgent and jaded it is until after he marries Cassandra. There's just a little issue from his past poses a threat and I have to admit, I was fascinated by that twist to the storyline.While I do personally recommend reading all the books in this series - just because I've honestly loved them - they can easily be read as stand alone stories and doing so won't detract from your enjoyment of them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","06 11, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

1020,B000ZKNRPK,"[0, 0]",3,"Emma Wildes short novella about an innocent aristocrat and a rake works very well in places and other times its a tad flat.The opening scenes of this novel are well written because it gives the reader a good background of the characters and they have a history which makes this novel believable.  Cassandra has always had a big crush on her brother's best friend nobleman Ross Benson.  Cassandra is young only nineteen and she is a bluestocking enjoying country pursuits much more than London gaiety.Ross and his friend are drunk and when Cassandra helps him to his room he engages in some romantic kisses that end up with the two in bed.  Ross does the honorable deed of course and offers for her and Cassandra agrees to the wedding.  She is astute enough to realize she could be pregnant.What follows mostly in this short story is their adjustment to married life.  Ross simply loves London and his wife does not.  Ross genuinely likes Cassandra but his feelings are not fully engaged until later.  I liked Ross because he did not take himself too seriously and he had a teasing but kind sense of humor.I cannot say the same about Cassandra who was tart, somewhat priggish (surprising for a woman whose first intimacies are outside marriage) and she just did not respond well to Ross's sweet teasing and innuendo.  He was a dynamic interesting person while Cassandra comes off as humorless and interested more in her books than her surroundings.  She never was as charismatic as her lead which leaves this book with a three star rating.","09 26, 2011",A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,Melissa,Liked the hero more than the heroine,1316995200
1021,B000ZKNRPK,"[1, 1]",5,"Ross Benson, Viscount Winterton, is recently returned from Africa.  He is a jaded rake of a man, and the object of many women's fantasies.  He and Timothy Rollins are arriving back at Ivydale Manor, drunk, when they wake young Cassandra, Timothy's sister, who helps both men to bed.  When she ends up in bed with Ross, her lifetime crush, it will have repercussions none of them counted on.Ross is handsome, sought after and has never had an inclination toward innocent young women.  For some unfathomable reason, Cassandra tempts him like no woman has before.  When he seduces her on a night of drunken stupor, he has no choice but to marry the alluring Cassandra.In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.  I thoroughly enjoyed Emma Wildes' In a Reckless Moment and I intend to purchase all of the previous titles.Scarletreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","05 16, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,In a Reckless Moment,1210896000

We meet a beautiful young woman that is saved by a caring older man via a platonic marriage. The opening scene is this h enjoying a dip in a river while unbeknownst to her, Devon, our H, is watching her lustfully from the trees.  The H is the son of her husband.  He was raised by his aunts after his mother died and the Father felt  unprepared to raise him by himself. Devon is later kidnapped and raised by a band of lawless men.  Devon is tough, dominant and ...yes...gorgeous .....and huge...in every way.....hence.....the cannon references.  As the story opens, Devon is on his way to see the Father he does not remember because he has been sent a message that the old man is dying.Devon,totally hot.  I dug his alpha ways and the sex scenes in which he is totally dom like.  I did feel sorry for the secondary male in the story, the doctor. There are some threesome scenes and the doc is more or less a foil to show how dom-like Devon is to the whole dynamic.I must admit, I read this book several weeks ago and cannot remember the heroine's name. Forgive me.  This is a long book. I paid a dollar for it and it is worth it.  The author attempts to make this more than just erotica by giving us a bigger story in which we follow the Hero on his trail ride to hunt and kill some fathomless bad guys.  This part I skimmed.  But  this is a sexy, erotic read if this is what you want.  Do not expect a deep introspective or thought provoking read.

Why make Lou Anne part of the master plan?  Why would a grown man take his grown date back to the HS cafeteria for a pizza date?  I know that the author tried to throw in some story about when they were teenagers and he took her to the cafeteria, but it seemed like an afterthought.  That little tidbit should have been included in all the other information in the beginning of the story.  I didn't find the prom thing romantic or fitting to the story at all.

It is magnificent and captivating, and it's apparent from the first chapter that Edgar Rice Burroughs is a genius. This is a wonderful story filled with his spectacular thoughts and imagination. Original, epic, and enthralling, I was unable to put it down and am chomping at the bit to read the next four books in the collection. A true master of the sci/fi adventure genre on par with Vance and Wells......""The Gods of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The hectic, chaotic, frenetic, pace continues as John Carter, his son Carthoris, and Tars Tarkas take on the Issus and the ""the blacks"" to rescue Dejah Thoris (Princess of Helium). Massive battles and unrelenting treachery and deceit continues to fuel the fusilade of destruction on the enemy air fleets. Pulp sci/fi adventure at its best makes this one of the most entertaining stories of all time from the pen of a master storyteller......""The Warlord of Mars"" saga and action continues unabated in the third book in the Barsoom Series and it's fantastic! Almost constant conflict confronts John Carter, Prince of Helium, as he fights for the release of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The budding love between their son Carthoris and Thuvia of Ptarth brings joy to both houses. Edge of your seat battles against the Lord of the Thenes, Matai Shang, and his minion Thurid will keep you awake at nights as the Jed's come together and unite under the Jedakk of Jedakaks, the Warlord of Barsoom!......""Thuvia, Maid of Mars""carries on and expands this epic collection of stories. Book IV of the series shifts the focus away from John Carter to his son Carthoris and Thuvia, the love of his life. Enduring many hardships and death defying battles and contraptions Carthoris rescues Thuvia and receives the blessing from Kulan Tith, her designated husband, to marry her in his stead. Although a bit repetitive with events/confrontations similar to the previous books this is never-the-less a thrilling roller coaster ride that will exhilarate and enthrall you throughout...onward to the V and final book in the collection......""The Chessmen of Mars"" is my least favorite book in ""The Barsoom Series."" I loved the pacing and one of the most original and imaginative creature/humanoid/ creations in all of science fiction ""Ghek the Kaldane from Bantoom."" Kaldane's are unquestionably one of the most unusual, unique, creepy, entertaining yet unsettling, beings ever conjured by an inditer in the sci/fi genre...a simply wonderful and amazing creature!

So why did I download THE ADVENTURES of ""John Carter on Mars"" - THE ORIGINAL FIVE STORIES? I'm not sure. Maybe because I had been reading H. Rider Haggard's ""Allan Quatermain"" series and saw a similarity between the stories about AQ and JC. Both are chock-full of adventure and nonstop action; take place in exotic locations: Africa and Mars; and both are easy to read while I jog on my treadmill. There are probably other reasons, but maybe they're of a subconscious nature.The storyline of ""A Princess of Mars"" (The first book in the series.) has already been mentioned, so I won't say too much more about it. Generally, though, it's a story about creatures who are always at war, the green Martians (ugly, very tall and unemotional) vs the red Martians (attractive, human-like and full of emotion).There is a lot of warring going on on the planet Barsoom/Mars with green Martians against red Martians and greens against other greens and reds battling other reds. Who, then, comes between them all and is captured at one time or another by both sides, wins some of their green and red hearts, is betrayed by green and red, imprisoned here and there, and ultimately...? None other than earth man John Carter, ex-captain in the CSA during the American Civil War, and unwitting traveler to this strange world. There is also a love story sandwiched in between the action and adventure segments.

When a marriage is arranged to a Duke's daughter it looks as if their money troubles are finally behind them.  But, when the Lady in question is found in a compromising position with Michael's brother, he just can't go through with the wedding.  Now he needs a rich heiress.  The only one that looks like they fit the bill is the ""upstart"" American Emma Marks.Emma is attracted to Michael but she thinks he is too rigid for her liking.

The more time she spends with him, and then there is the kiss, the more she thinks they will suit.

He's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates.  His father refused and Dylan's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful.  He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire.  His has very little funds, is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he's staying and his father's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry, Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman.  She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they're all far more interested in her monetary value then her.  Besides, she's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless.  There's only one man who appeals to her, Captain Dylan Blake, but he's a second son and doesn't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father's all-important annual ball.  Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late.  While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan's audacity, Natalia is intrigued.  She's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake.  Once there, Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan's choosing.  The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish.  The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he's never had any trouble charming any woman, Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he's become.  There's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down.  Dylan's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who's too smart to accept any less than all of him.  Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia's story.  Dylan's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much.  Natalia is impossible not to like - she's smart, beautiful and not at all pretentious.  I loved the emotional turmoil both characters experience throughout this storyline and especially enjoyed how Dylan learns about the family secrets his father tried so hard to keep hidden from him.

He foolishly takes on a bet to get Lady Natalia to dance two dances in one evening with him.  He feels that with his charm it will be one way that he can finally get some funds.  He doesn't count on being rebuked by the lady and then charmed by her whole being.Lady Natalia Sinclair is the only child of the Duke of Clayton and therefore has a huge dowry.

Would Natalia's broken trust be too big an obstacle for the two awakened hearts to overcome?***  Tracy Seybold writing as Diana Bold has once again captivated me with her skillful blend of intriguing plots and intelligent characters. My only problem with this story was that I started it too late in the evening and had trouble putting it down - so much so that after much tossing and turning, I to get up and finish it!Bold fashioned Dylan as a very compelling and intriguing man terribly hurt by his inability of having his father demonstrate any loving kindness towards him except in the form of disgust.  After ten years of heroic fighting Dylan sold his commission quickly running through his funds.  Knowing it would infuriate his father Dylan showed up late for a fete and his father cut off him off financially which partly explains his drunken error as to how he was so easily goaded into a wager - a wager which in itself was actually quite innocent.  Just have the very snooty daughter of a duke dance twice in one night with him.  Having caught the lady's eye earlier in the evening Dylan was sure of his charm and utterly shocked when the seeming star struck young woman refused to dance with him.Natalia was a victim of low self-esteem.  At school she'd been the victim of jealousy, and made to think that the only attractive thing about her was her huge dowry.  As a young impressionable girl this peer pressure marked her and wariness of anyone who tried to get close. Having followed Dylan's exploits of heroism during the war, Natalia was infatuated with the hero, but not enough to fall at his feet.  It wasn't until she had a chance to get to know and talk to him that she was able to understand and begin to trust; especially when she realized that he sought  the very same thing as she - someone who really cared.","01 6, 2008",A3B48AN8JID1JK,M.

However, this has not stopped her from dreaming about a war hero who seems to be nothing like the men of society--who only see her large dowry when they look at her. She has built up the reputation as a cold lady who follows her own strict rule of not allowing two dances to the same gentleman at a ball. In reality, she doesn't wish to encourage any man who she knows will not meet with her father's approval. Dylan is the unloved, unwanted second son of an earl.

Only the girl is warm and kind and seems to see through him like no one else ever cared to. He never counted on losing his heart but he may have just wagered more than he bargained to lose.I could totally relate to Natalia--who feared being wanted for something other than herself.

Steve Peek has a unique talent for building believable characters that you can't help but identify with. This story is very complex and has a lot of elements that I had not seen before, and was not at all what I had expected.If you like books that will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire experience, this is the book to choose. I was particularly fascinated with the way his characters reacted to things. The suspense he manages to build through their uncertainty and terror leaves you half afraid to turn the page, but half afraid not to. This is the type of book that could be adapted into a very exciting movie. The author's descriptions are detailed and bring the book to life before your eyes as though you are watching a film. Here is an example of his descriptive writing:""The house looked as if it had never seen a coat of paint. The gray planks warped and strained against the rusty nails, which bled dark-red streaks from years of rain."" Rather than telling the reader everything that is going to happen step by step, Steve Peek allows us to connect the dots and reveals his story through the actions of his characters.There was no extra fluff or poorly utilized space in this novel.By the time you reach the middle of this book, the pages turn furiously.

That meant you only had 70% of the book left in which to get to know them and feel something for them.It took a while, but eventually I did start to care for a couple of the characters. I think the kicker for me though, the turning point in my feelings for the book, revolved solely around the dog. I felt more for that wiry-haired pooch than any of the other characters. That could be because I'm an animal person, but I don't think so. In fact I believe it's got more to do with the characterisation that the dog had that the other characters were lacking.The antagonists were brilliant creations of horrific proportions, but strangely humanesque in some of their actions, protecting their young and mates for example, and so completely alien in other aspects.I didn't really appreciate the dialogue around them and their existence in their world; I think it would have been enough knowing that they came from a hellish world without all the rest of it too.The thing that kept me engaged and enjoying this story was the science/history behind the different worlds. The ley lines and the Indian culture, the standing stones and the magic that was obviously so thoroughly researched by Steve. That part of the story was steeped in so much truth that even though it was completely 'out there' I found myself wanting to believe it too.I didn't much like how things ended, but then I can't say I didn't expect it a little anyway. Steve seemed to enjoy mutilating characters, finding creative ways to dispatch them from the story and well, I guess I came to expect that any characters were potential targets, even those who deserved a second chance at things or ones who were young and innocent.This book is certainly not for the feint-hearted. It starts off slowly enough, but by the end of it you'll be wading through so much blood and guts it all just starts to blur together.This book could do with another pass over by an editor.

1085,B0010ZGPB2,"[1, 1]",5,"From [...]I have never before read a book like Steve Peek's Long Claws.It is a thriller and a horror story. The tale unfolds with so much mystery, sections of the story delivered one chunk at a time, that you're held captive to its pages simply out of a desire to find out why something happened in a previous chapter. It's one of those books that keeps you saying, ""Okay, just one more page and then I'll mow the lawn."" And you keep saying it over and over until you're at the last page, not knowing how you got there so quickly.Mr. Peek tells the story from many perspectives, jumping around from character to character, revealing the bigger picture in stages. Normally, for me, this is a writing style that puts me off; I like to bond with my main character, and I don't like it when the narrative runs off to follow someone else. But with Long Claws, although there is a main character, the other characters that are touched upon are just as unique and interesting. With each turn of the tale, I was surprised to feel a little disappointed that I had to take leave of the character I'd just been following - that's a good thing. It means I was fully invested in each and every one of them, a strong testament to the author's skill.And here is the most amazing part: some of the characters followed are insects, some are werewolves (sort of), some are regular people, and others are people with special powers of awareness. Yes - insects. Steve Peek takes you into the minds and inner workings of a species of insects he's created. And he does it well.This story is epic. The majority of it spans the course of a fifty(ish) year period, but its roots go back tens of thousands of years. Modern mysteries and legends are woven into the fabric of new legends that are the foundation of this story.This isn't a story that begins with a bang. Do not put it down if you are not hooked by the first five pages. You will not be disappointed if you continue the story to its conclusion.","07 13, 2013",A3IT3XAOJKN59B,Matthew Keith,A Must-Read for Horror Fans - A Truly Original Story!,1373673600
1086,B0010ZGPB2,"[1, 1]",4,"I was immediately drawn by the book's cover. It reminds me of those lurid (meant in a good way!) covers on old horror stories which I love and miss with today's generic appearance of most books. The plot summary sealed the deal: I had to read this one!Three different story-lines are intricately woven into a compelling story: a clan of vampire-like beings called longclaws living in a parallel, prehistoric-like world, hunting for fresh blood and hiding from other, even more menacing creatures. An ancient Indian tribe knowing about the dangerous otherworldly beasts and closing the energy lines leading to their world. A teenage runaway boy ending up with his old great-uncle who lives to protect humanity by guarding the portal.Then one longclaw discovers a way to cross the border into paradise: our human world, where they are superior predators among easy prey. A brutal fight for survival begins - on both sides.The author uses different time lines, parallel worlds and different points of view, sometimes retelling a scene as experienced from both humans and longclaws. Where other books get lost in their overwhelming, confusing complexity, that is never the case with longclaws, where all parts converge into a coherent and unique whole.The underlying premise that our folklore especially about vampires and werewolves stems from encounters with creatures from another dimension mark Longclaws as an outstanding work in the 'fangs&claws;' genre. However, this distinctive novel will surely appeal to fans of all types of horror.(I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review)","04 10, 2013",A39K0X3OH4SSZL,misspider,Wow!,1365552000
1087,B0010ZGPB2,"[4, 4]",4,"At first glance, I almost dismissed Longclaws as a seen-it-before monster novel, derivative of that 1980's horror that filled my bookshelves long ago.  I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.  I can only hope that he has a few more tales to dust off and put out there, because I want to see what else lurks in the darkness of his brain.","03 18, 2013",A231LBC8EGPO5L,"OutlawPoet - In a Corrupt Stew ""OutlawPoet""",Mmmm....Monsters....,1363564800

It's one of those novels where there are two themes unfolding in alternating chapters. But they tie in together brilliantly.It starts off with creatures from a distance past. The kind of creatures legends are made out of. But people never take as having an ounce of truth in it. You are introduced to Longclaws a clan of animals that are vicious, bloodthirsty yet protective of their own. But they are not alone in this unforgiving world. The reader is taken on an adventure as the book describes them beautifully where you can imagine in your mind what is being written. Kudos on that alone. The picture has been painted well.Enter the Mason family who has a history and knowledge of the creatures. They are the keepers of the entrance that separates our world from theirs. It is imperative the doors remain close. For the alternative would involve chaos and destruction for both worlds.This book starts off a little slow. However I encourage the reader to keep reading.

Animals begin acting wildly.  The lives of several Peculiar residents are linked together in this suspenseful, science fiction novel.I enjoyed this novel because it was suspenseful in parts, had well developed characters and was very well written.For the most part, the book was suspenseful and a page turner.  I had to get to the next page, chapter and definitely had to find out how it all ended!  However, there were some scenes that I felt were too long or drawn out.  This took away from some of the scenes.  I especially felt this way near the end of the book where I think it was filled with too much description.  I felt it was slower-paced with lots of explanation that was not necessary.  That being said, I want to reiterate that there was good suspense and at no point did I want to stop reading or skip to the end.I felt the book was a bit gory.  I expected a science fiction novel but this was a hybrid - mostly science fiction with a few pages of gore.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and I wouldn't take off any stars, but it's just good for a reader to know.  It's now tagged as ""horror"" as well and I think that tag wasn't there when I purchased the book.I was a little disappointed with Rachel's storyline.  I wanted to know more about her link to the unspeakable crime in the past.  Without giving anything away here, I suppose I expected more resolution on that side story regarding said crime.The characters were great.  I felt connected to all of them and I could empathize with them.  I cared about what happened to them and wanted to see how the story turned out for each and every one of them.  I enjoyed being on an adventure with these characters.  I'd go on another one with them.  I think I would have liked to see Gordon more developed but maybe that was the point - he was supposed to be a bit mysterious.  I enjoyed (for the most part) the character of Rollins.  He was a bit uneven but I liked that.  I liked how the point of view changed.  It wasn't hard to follow and the reader gets to experience the storylines of the different characters.There was a lot of science in the book.  I have no idea if it was accurate or not but there was a lot of scientific description that was way over my head.  Thankfully one of the characters felt the same way :-) so another character regularly  explained the science behind the aliens.  However, it was still a lot for my taste.  All in all, I found the book to be very well written.  Robert Williams is a very talented author and I plan to see what else he has written.","03 8, 2010",A1YTA3TBWBPCPG,blondie,A Peculiar Invasion,1268006400

The story reminded me a bit of a cross between ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but in fact it's neither. In ""Andromeda Strain,"" the action takes place primarily at a remote laboratory where scientists study the alien organism that has infected and killed most of a small town's population. In ""Peculiar, MO,"" the action is in the town itself and centers around the organism's effects on the local people and a biological terrorism military unit that is studying the alien organism and trying to limit its spread. The tension grows steadily as the unit's scientist comes to the terrifying realization that the organism is attempting to invade the earth, not just infect it.The author's scientific explanation of the mechanism by which the alien plasmids (short strands of DNA) could use earth's plants and animals, including humans, to regenerate the alien species and rebuild its group consciousness and memory is quite detailed. I don't remotely have enough science background to know how plausible this is, but it was a fascinating concept that was more credible than the typical aliens-invade-human-bodies stories. I'll give the author a lot of credit for originality.The author builds the story around several characters. The principal characters, including Kelly Ross, Spencer Dale, and the mysterious John Gordon, are likable, well developed three-dimensional characters. There are some bad guys too, and the author kills them off in some very satisfying (i.e., gruesome) ways.As another reviewer noted, the military unit involved in the story was very small and was led by a non-commissioned officer, with privates doing most of the work. This wasn't very realistic, since the government had already dealt with a previous meteor strike that contained the alien plasmids, so the potential danger was recognized. I'm guessing that the author's reasoning was that a larger unit, such as a battalion, would have brought too much attention from the local people. In any case, this is a fairly minor quibble.Having read other stories by Robert Williams, I expected the writing to be of professional quality, and it was. The story flowed smoothly from scene to scene, and the characters' dialog was realistic. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and the action is pretty much nonstop, ending in an extremely tense and violent climax. Blended smoothly into the action is the relationship between Kelly and Spencer and the blossoming romance that brings them closer together.Editing was generally good, but there were a number of typos in my Kindle version. There weren't enough mistakes to affect my enjoyment of the book, but the author should have proofread his final manuscript more closely.No spoilers here, but after reading ""Peculiar, MO,"" I don't know if I'll ever turn my back on a cat again!The bottom line: This is a first rate page-turner for science fiction and techno-thriller fans.

What I did get was a book that slowly captured my interest and pulled me into its pages. Before I got the e-book, I worried a bit about the plot line as it sounded just like another of the Dan Brown ""wanna-bes""; however, the ""Secret of the Scroll"" by Chester D. Campbell delivers on all levels and is a wonderful read and a thriller that is hard to put down.Retired Air Force OSI Agent Greg McKenzie and his wife Jill are on a trip to the Holy Land. Shortly before they return home, a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase a ""souvenir"" that turns out to be an ancient scroll. When they innocently return home, the McKenzie's world turns upside down as Jill is taken hostage in a battle between militant Palestinians and radical Israelis to recover this ancient scroll. The police, however, target Greg as a suspect in his wife's disappearance, and with a little help from his friends (and a few others), he sets out alone in a perilous chase to save his wife as she is spirited out of America and back to Israel.The ""Secret of the Scroll"" is honestly a classic page-turner; I often kept reading when I knew I should go to sleep. I just kept saying; ""Just one more chapter.""  It is a thriller without a large body count; it is a book about an historical artifact without trying to clone Dan Brown.  Yes, there is plenty of action and intrigue, but the real suspense comes from all of McKenzie's efforts to save his wife while trying to stay a step ahead of the mysterious figures who will stop at nothing to get the scroll. While there are many twists and turns in store for the reader, there is as well a strong realism in the characterization of the main character who seems to be a bit more like your neighbor rather than a James Bond super-hero type. You will like these characters and you will like the book - ""Secret of the Scroll"" (Greg McKenzie Mysteries #1).","09 23, 2012",A3QAC4ZQ5E7OLU,Carl E.

He has derailed his career several times by blowing his lid and spouting off.  Greg has a chip on his shoulder because he feels that his former supervisors and co-workers  have singled him out for retribution.  He's probably right.When Greg and his wife Jill take a trip to the Holy Land with a church group, Greg is supposed to work on his anger management skills.  So when they are returning home at the end of the trip, Greg feels the he and Jill are singled out for unfair treatment by customs and airport security.Then Jill is kidnapped.  The kidnappers, a group of Palestinians, want a scroll that is in Greg's possession.  It seems that a souvenir scroll that Greg bought is actually a real ancient relic.  Then another group, this time radical Israelis, contact him about the scroll.Because of his past actions, Greg cannot count on much help from local law enforcement, or the FBI.  Fortunately, he does have a few friends that help him out.  Greg's investigation leads to a tangled trail of international intrigue.What does the scroll say?Why do two different political groups want the scroll?And, can Greg find a way to stay alive and rescue Jill?In this novel, Chester Campbell has created a unique character.

Toward the end we are told the narrator (of atwoods book) is nameless. This ought to have been stated toward the beginning to eliminate  confusion. Then we are told the nameless narrator is a device to pull readers into the story:&#8220;Read as living myth, Margaret Atwood's fine novel becomes the nameless narrator's service to her community, which now includes us, the thoughtful reader.&#8221;It is difficult for readers to identify with a nameless narrator, but it is challenging for a writer to dare to do this.In this essay, a layered cake is used as the metaphor for the world and our perception of it. The icing represents our surface only existence. Only Shamans can break free to explore all the inner layers.  In the end we are encouraged to take the plunge into knowledge and awaken humanity to the fullness of existence.This book was a confusing book, (and probably also Atwood&#8217;s Surfacing book, which I did not read) which explains/applies the brilliant concepts which are clearly detailed in Joseph Campbell&#8217;s book, Hero of a Thousand Faces.

The story flowed effortlessly from page to page, reeling me in and not letting up until the end. In fact, I found myself thinking about Cade and Elliot later when doing my own chores. But don't get me wrong, thinking about them aside, there were parts that drove me crazy and got under my skin. To me, an emotional attachment is the mark of a great story. This one fit the bill.Cade is a piece of pierced work. He's not about to conform to any standards except the lack of standards. His need to be his own man was endearing. What I loved about him was his fallibility. He's been through a bad relationship and bears the scars, but he's still breathing, still going about his life. I had to hand it to him. Many people would crack, especially after the circumstances he'd lived with, but he didn't.Elliot is the character I wanted to cuddle. Seriously. Handsome, yes. Young, sure. But in his own way, he'd lived through odd circumstances. I wanted to know a bit more about his back story and his foiled attempts at relationships, but given the length of the story, I still enjoyed learning about him. His strength was what drew me to him. He appeared fragile at times, but it merely masked his true devotion to Cade. Great stuff.I can't leave out the love scenes. Ms. Mitchell writes carefully constructed love scenes that never fail to warrant a chilled drink and the need to hunt down that special person. I felt the love and lust between Cade and Elliot when even they weren't sure the experience was more than just sex. The scene in the backseat of ""Bucky"" the Plymouth had me reading and rereading just to savor the experience.If you want a book that's sure to make you blush for the best reasons, you need to read Hot Ticket.

Something I thought was interesting which is not usually touched on was that Cade's ex had been having unsafe sex and he'd been tested but had to wait until his 6 month test came back clean. I always understood that you needed that 6 month window but I know in most books once they get that first test that they are clean everything is bareback city.

Not completely but enough.Basically, Delia is trying to get more people to support the library. It's not doing so well and the Library Appreciation day is coming up and she knows she needs something huge to get people to show. She tells everyone a surprise visitor is coming. Little do they know it's Bobo, the retired hockey player that lives in town and his act has been done over and over again. That is until Justin Archer shows up out of now where. Voted American Woman's sexist man alive. Unfortunately, before Delia could ask him for his help he leaves.Delia finds herself locked in the basement with Justin and he wants to keep their identities secret. Mainly, because he doesn't want the girl to recognize him as the sexiest man alive. What Justin doesn't know is that Delia knows exactly who he is. They talk for hours and hours and really get to know each other. Without being able to see each other.The ending was a little too gooey for me. I'm thinking there should have been some hard feelings in there somewhere. Things don't always work out the way you want them to. I'm thinking if the ending was a little more dragged out, it would have made more sense. Or at least been more believable. It was a cute fast read.","10 4, 2010",A3LHIRT4SR3F9T,"Nikki W.

1197,B00149M19E,"[1, 1]",5,"Ok, so this book is relatively short, coming in around 9200 words, under 40 pages.  Right off the bat it starts with a sexy shower scene - my favorite!  I don't know what it is, but the water, the steam, the whole thing just sets me off.  Here we meet Brett and Lisa, human and vampire, respectively.  And as it turns out, they are in a relationship, eleven months so far.I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.  They respected each other for what they were, and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed, Brett (and I) thought nothing of it.But here I'm going to break off from the characters for a minute to talk about On The Edge, the club.  This place is very much a character in the story, itself.  It's vampire and human friendly, a place for them to meet and mingle, and sometimes even more.  Drink blood, or ""dirty wine"", or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy.  It's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways, loud music, and great ambiance.In the club, Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo.  Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit.  Um, hello, what about Brett??  So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share, I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett's apprehension.But that Lisa, she's a smarty.  And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her, I felt betrayed for Brett, and in a very bad way.  I called Lisa some very bad names.  But like I said, she's smart.  Don't underestimate that girl, and don't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo?  He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books.  I absolutely adore this man, and his lack of inhibitions. He's tall, dark, and handsome.  Sexy and mysterious.  Dangerous.  All of the above, and all things vampire.This story was m-m-f and m-f-m.  And it was so wonderful and beautiful, and unbearably hot.  I definitely recommend it, and I definitely recommend reading it first, before moving on any more in the On The Edge series.","05 19, 2013",A1A7YPC6UBZZIY,Liz @ Fictional Candy,"Sexy and Hot, and all things Wonderful!",1368921600

They're appearance in those stories had piqued my interest.The club On The Edge was only 3 months old but it had been an instant success with the people of Haventown. Both human and vampire alike. It's success was so great that it's owner Brett had to hire more help. After a hard day of interviews he was ready for a quiet night at home. Instead he found himself in whole different, but much more pleasing situation.Though short I loved reading this. Number one, the whole idea of vampires and humans mingling and having fun on the dance floor and in the dark alcoves makes me shiver. It makes me want to put on my dancing shoes and a slinky dress!

1210,B0014BRMKA,"[0, 0]",5,"The traumatic meeting of Emerald Sandford and Asher Wellingham, Duke of Carisbrook occurs five years before the story begins, when she's the 16-year-old member of her nobleman-turned-pirate father's crew and he's the 26-year-old captain of one of his merchant ships. Discovering she's female, Asher refuses to fight her, because, even when beseiged by pirates, a gentleman never harms a lady.  Emerald repays him by knocking him overboard and out of harm's way, not knowing this will make Asher the pirates' captive. It eventually loses him the use of his right hand and his brother his sight. Asher escapes and returns to wipe out the stronghold and kill her father and this is where the story begins. Emerald follows him to England. It isn't for revenge but to retrieve her father's walking stick he took because inside it is the map to a treasure she can use to pay off Beau Sandford's debts and free herself from the past.Using her father's family name and right to a title, Emerald becomes Lady Emma Seaton. Naturally Asher's suspicious of her and intrigued because of her obvious lies and uneasiness in high society. Of course they fall in love but this is more an in-depth study of the main characters attitudes than a mere will-they/won't-they love story. Asher is bound by duty and honor...and extreme guilt. His wife died while he was seeking his revenge, his brother was blinded during his rescue. He returns to his family home a widower, disabled in body, but more disabled in spirit, blaming himself for the tragedies occurring during his own travail. Emerald meanwhile sees herself as the cause. If she hadn't knocked him overboard, none of this would've happened.  Still pursuing her hunt for the walking stick, she believes the only way she can repay Asher for the misery she  has caused is to become his mistress and give him back  the love he lost and remove his grief over his brother's condition.It's an interesting story and an entertaining one, sensuous in spots, but staying away from the ballrooms and usual locales for such tales with most of the action taking place at Asher's estate. Flashbacks give reasons for everything that happens instead of playing them out in detail. Though this is the only James' novel I've read, I got the feeling there may be more on this family because of various hints given. If so, I'd like to read them,too.Harlequin Historical #888This novel was a gift to the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.","06 8, 2014",A3S7REHVBOSTLR,Toni V.

Set in the art world it is filled with spies and political intrigue.Kay McCann is an artist, a Master Artist. She has been involved with two very different men, Peter Lawson a world renowned painter and Jason Allen a gallery owner and expert in art forgeries. Each man has their own agenda where Kay is concerned, each man is manipulative and coldly calculating. Kay unwittingly becomes a pawn between the two men.I enjoyed the premise for this novel. I couldn't quite decide who Kay would ultimely end up with. Kay was a well written character, open, generous and forgiving. IMO too forgiving at times. I did have some qualms for Kay, as she was quite blinded and naive with both Peter and Jason. For a Master Artist who was able to convey so much emotion through her art I expected her to be more &#34;worldly&#34; or aware of what was happening around her,  the repercussions of her actions.I did enjoy this but I do agree with another reviewer that the pace did lag a bit in the middle and it wasn't all tied up as neatly at the end as I would have liked.

1232,B0014YB7LM,"[11, 15]",5,"When deciding whether or not to give this novel a try, keep the old saying in mind: ""Never judge a book by its cover."" The dainty-looking lass gracing ""The May Carousel's"" cover is Kay McCann--a promising California artist and teacher whose personality and life are anything but picture-perfect. Brandishing only a blue streak, she rescues her seemingly soft-spoken English art model, Jason Allen, from a carjacking.  Jason, like Kay, is also not what he seems because once he accepts Kay's offer to mend his wounds, his secret plan for her is hatched.  And once Kay lets Jason through her apartment door, the plan is well on its way; and soon, so are they--from L.A. to London in a tantilizing search for the man who painted Kay's portrait, Peter Lawson: an internationally-renown ""artist"" thought to be dead...until now.""The May Carousel"" adds warmth, maturity, and a degree of realism to the spy genre. It's largely British in tone but more reminiscent of a John Buchan or Alfred Hitchcock romantic mystery than an Ian Fleming or John le Carre Cold War saga. Much like the artwork that populates the novel, author Leslie Wooddavis's characters are well-drawn. Some gravitate more toward the greater good that espionage purports to protect. But for the most part, their lives are more colorful than those living in  le Carre's gray surroundings; and their personalities, deeper than the martini-sipping swagger of the typical 007 stick figure.Kay McCann is a refreshingly humorous and self-reliant woman who is slowly drawn into suave art dealer Jason Allen's snare. But if you think Jason is the villain, again, ""Never judge a book..."" It's another high mark for Wooddavis's style: It's clever in how well it constructs its characters. Genuine love, trust, and friendship begin to sway Jason's thoughts. And Kay recovers the love, trust, and friendship that she thought was lost--felt only in fleeting flashbacks. It all makes for a potent story that builds to a truly stunning--though regrettably sensible--conclusion that will catch most readers by surprise.If the story itself is compelling, the pace lags in places--particularly in the middle. The beginning has a strong hook, with the introduction of Jake Thorton (Jason's smarmy American associate who is as adept at the art of deception as he is art dealing). Jason's wooing of Kay is a bit too involved at the start, but does the trick. But once the proceedings reach London, the novel spends too much time sorting through a love triangle. Though a few car chases and Kay's melees with would-be kidnappers help put things back in perspective, the excessive emphasis placed on romantic complexities almost undermines the greater idea: That art and romance are tactics in a bigger game being played.Still, Leslie Wooddavis triumphs in delivering a first-rate read--effective storytelling highlighted by a memorable cast of characters brought to life by a plot and dialog that  switch from sentimental to self-controlled on a dime. But best of all, ""The May Carousel"" is unique in its ability to add human warmth to the spy story scene--a genre that is typically a cold-blooded battle royal of barbs, bullets, and bombs.","12 15, 2011",AV64Y0L3C45UX,James Blakley,May adds warmth to typically cold-blooded spy genre,1323907200

Frankly it was like he was being paid to write a story of so many words for a magazine and he suddenly realized that he needed to finish so the story quickly and abruptly ends.The story starts off well like one of Andre Norton's space interplanetary exploration teams making first contact with a new race.  The man assigned the task of making first contact knows the new race cannot be trusted and he knows that they have captured a space ship.  Suddenly within a few questions he solves the puzzle of where the ship is and turns the tables on his captor.  The story ends so quickly it makes you wonder why you wasted your time reading it.  It is only about 30 minutes of reading time so if you have an interest in the book then go ahead and enjoy it.

Much like he'd like to grab her...Never has blackmail looked so dang good!  Marie Harte's newest release with Samhain Publishing, Enjoying the Show leaves me wondering if I should take up voyeurism as a hobby myself!  And if I had a neighbor like Gage Warren, I think I just might.  After all, it worked out very well for Hailey, did it not?  lolDespite the blackmail, Gage certainly never forces Hailey into anything she does not want.  In fact, he goes out of his way to leave her with choices, needing her to realize how much she cares for him and that this is not just a temporary sexual fling, but a real relationship to him.Although she trusts Gage, Hailey is nevertheless slow to trust his feelings for her as anything more than transient.  But having gotten her attention with some really great sex, Gage easily wins her heart with his unending patience and the ways he shows her how much she means to him as a person and friend, instead of just a bed partner.Every time I read another Marie Harte story, I become a bigger fan of this talented author.

1254,B0015YEQ6O,"[22, 28]",4,"Hailey Jennison was uncomfortable with her body, and had always been shy because of it.  She had developed early, and had to constantly deal with unwanted attention from men.  She didn't go out very often, but did enjoy getting together with her friends on Friday nights.  They had recently become obsessed with a neighbor that provided an exciting sideshow for them.  He is a construction worker named Gage Warren with an incredibly sculpted body he didn't mind showing them frequently.  One night when Gage caught them looking in his windows, they scattered, but not fast enough because before she knew it Hailey had been dragged to his apartment.  He had been attracted to Hailey from the first moment he saw her, and now that he saw his chance, he was going to take it.After they had been together a couple of weeks, Hailey finally told him what he had known all along.  She was afraid he would leave if they didn't have sex, and equated it to her dad leaving her when she was just a small child.  Gage couldn't believe she didn't get it.  He was completely in love with her, and now he just had to get her to believe it.  There was no way he would let her get away.Gage and Hailey are a fun couple.  Hailey has a lot of issues to work out, but Gage loves her and is willing to wait as long as it takes so they can be together forever.  His family is also priceless.  Most people have meddlesome family members, but the fact that two of his work in the mental health field, make the dynamics even more comical since they feel compelled to constantly give advice.","06 13, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Enjoying the Show,1213315200

She gets together with her friends every Friday to watch the hot neighbor who walks around naked in his apartment without closing his curtains. They don't know his name so they call him Mr. Tool; partly because they can tell he works construction, partly because they've seen his massive ""hammer"".The hottie catches her in the parking lot and tells her he knows they've been watching him. He says she needs to come discuss the situation in private or he'll call the cops. Once inside his apartment, he gives her a choice: take him to dinner, or go to jail for peeping.Gage Warren had wanted to meet Hailey for months, then she moved out of the apartment complex and he was afraid he had missed his opportunity. Now that he's got her, he knows he doesn't ever want to let her go.Enjoying the Show by Marie Harte is a fantastic book with lava-hot sex and characters who quickly realize that what they're feeling is a lot more than mere lust. Gage and Hailey are immensely likeable because both have trouble talking to the opposite sex and both have trouble with relationships. Their imperfections make readers really care about their budding relationship. I love that they feel like they're addicted to each other. Enjoying the Show is extremely well-written and believable, and readers will love seeing Hailey and Gage explore their feelings for each other.

1270,B0015YEQ6O,"[1, 2]",4,"~* 3.5 Stars *~It's innocent, if slightly indecent fun. About as indecent as the shy and a little uptight Hailey Jennison gets, actually. She and her friends get together every Friday night for some very specific girl time. Gathering around the window in her friend's apartment, lights off, snacks and drinks in hand, they look out the window and down into the apartment of the man they refer to as Mr. Tool.The man is smoking hot and has a habit of walking around his apartment barely clothed, sometimes not clothed at all (and aren't those happy nights!), with his lights on and his shades up. Hey, a girl's gotta grab whatever salacious fun she can, right? It's harmless and he's the man of her dreams - literally. Then she goes out to get some more booze for the girl's night and Mr. Tool confronts her about her and her friends' weekly activities.Mr. Tool...Gage for those who actually know him as more than just a bit of man candy, gives Hailey an ultimatum. Either she goes out on a date with him, or he calls the cops and files a complaint about her and her friends' weekly peeping.For six months Gage has been hoping for a chance with Hailey. She had moved out of the complex before he worked up the courage to talk to her, but he caught her and her friends spying on him one night and has gone out of his way to make sure she has plenty to see ever since. True, blackmailing the woman for a date isn't exactly the most gallant thing he's ever done, but it got the job done. Finally. Now, if he can just manage to get through the date without opening his mouth and sticking one or both feet into it.To say Gage is socially awkward around women would be a gross understatement. It makes starting a relationship hard, especially when he is as attracted to a woman as he is Hailey. A little blackmail seems a small matter for his pride, though, if it gets him a shot with Hailey.~*~This deliciously erotic little bit of yumminess was fun for a hot, quick read. The plot was a bit light, and I'm not sure I bought the whole gorgeous-guy-has-to-blackmail-a-girl-for-a-date concept, but the characters were likable and the sex was abundant and hot. Sometimes, that's all I need to be happy with an erotic novella like this.I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.I wish that Harte had pushed the envelope of Gage's awkwardness around women even further, because he never really struck me that way when he was around Hailey. He certainly wasn't Mr. Charming, but to have built up the level of neurosis he had over his lack of ability to speak to women without saying something wrong, I would have expected him to be much, much worse than he was. Maybe if he'd been even more blunt, or less endearing with his clumsiness, I would have bought into it a bit more.Hailey didn't do much for me, really. She didn't annoy, but she's too familiar as the uptight, tightly wound Type A personality bordering on prissy. The girl with a killer bod and an ice maiden exterior fashioned from her fear of pain. I wish more originality had gone into her character, but she at least held her own.I'm not a fan of the quick-to-love theme in romance, even in erotic novellas. That, for me, was the bigger issue with the story. I wish the romance had been given a longer lead time, even if it had been in condensed form. I also would have liked a meatier plot, and I'm no fan of relationship conflict that's nothing more than a failure to communicate, as it was here. Those are the things that held me back from completely liking what I read.It was hot, though, I'll say that. And I do have a soft spot for the themes of unrequited love (or lust) and love (lust) from afar, like Gage had for Hailey. He was kind of geeky-cute with his affections and I enjoyed that aspect very much. For a quick read that will definitely raise a gal's body temp, I'd recommend this one, but I personally would have liked more story and a less annoying conflict.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","04 13, 2012",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Sexy Little Bite of Yum,1334275200

She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","03 19, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

She almost had it all in Parker West, but he was predictable, boring, and proposed to her in a most unromantic way.  Celia was not selfish, but she refused to settle for less than everything, so she turned down the unacceptable proposal.  When Parker showed up at her front door, tied her up, and carried her off to an unknown location, she was frightened, but yet excited by his spontaneity.Parker was risking everything on this last chance effort.  He had known the difficult Celia all his life, and being a kind gentleman had gotten him nowhere, so he hoped unleashing his darker dominant side might penetrate her steel defenses.  When they arrived at his cabin, she responded to this side of him better than he could have ever anticipated.  If he would have known this was all it took, he would have introduced this aspect of his sexuality years ago.  His next proposal, although done while both of them were naked and in bed, was readily accepted.When neighbor Rance Colter tried to stop the quickie wedding in town, Parker knew it was only a sign of things to come.  He knew that Rance had wanted to claim Celia for his own, but she had never wanted him in return.  Now that Celia was his, Parker set up extra protection at his ranch as well as Celia's.  He didn't put anything past Colter, and knew he would try something soon.  Her being married would not stop him.  That is one thing Parker had no doubt about.  When Celia was abducted from home, both families swore she would be returned unharmed whatever the cost.A traditional formula that works well with this story.

1306,B0015YEQNM,"[1, 1]",4,"This is the complete trilogy, plus a short story, of Poison Study (Book 1), Magic Study (Book 2), and Fire Study (Book 3).Poison Study was Ms. Snyder's debut novel, and it was excellent! I borrowed the hard copy, and enjoyed it so much, I immediately bought the Bundle so I would have all the books, and all in the same place. I will be buying more of Ms. Snyder's books!These books are what I would call High Fantasy, though there are no dragons. There are Sorcerers, Magicians, and of course, Mundanes - no dragons. I believe they would easily cross to a genre I seldom read and even more seldom enjoy, Romance.As I read fiction for escape, this was perfect! I could escape into a world lush with characters, geography, and conflict.Poison Study starts off with our heroine, Yelena, being brought out of her cell in the dungeon to stand before the #2 man of the country. He gives her a choice. She can face the executioner for her crime of killing the son of a noble, or she can face the possibility of a slow and agonizing death at some future date, and become the official taster of the Commander (who runs the country.)Because there might be a way for her to escape, and this is at the beginning of the story, she accepts the latter. An honest person, she wins either the fast and loyal friendship of many, or the undying hatred.When the Commander took over the country, he outlawed all magic, seeing it as evil, and any who had abilities either did their best to escape to Ixia, where magic was not only allowed, but nurtured, or were killed trying.As the story unfolds, we learn Yelena was an orphan, taken and raised under the protection and education of General Brazell (whose son she killed). By the end of the story, we learn she was not an orphan, but had been kidnapped for her hoped for, and anticipated, magical abilities.Life for Yelena was not pleasant in the orphanage, and only slightly more pleasant as a Taster, but at least it was life.Magic Study finds Yelena reunited with her birth family, and on her way to learning to use and control her magic. Again, her choice is: Learn to use it, or burn yourself out, unless killed first.In Magic Study, she finds herself in a strange place, untrusted, even by her brother, accused of being a spy, with few friends, and a nasty habit of charging ahead without thinking everything through.Fire Study is the third and final book in the trilogy. Yelena finds her true magic, which frightens everyone, including her. She is a Soulfinder, one of the most powerful of all magics. By now all the characters are known, or at least most of them, and we're aware of Yelena's foibles, and her undying loyalties.She tries to avert a war, is caught, imprisoned, escapes, and has a price on her head. The First Magician wants her dead, the Fire Starter wants her soul, and the Commander's Assassin wants her.For the most part, this was a page burner. Once I started reading it, it was very difficult to put down. So why only 4 stars? Because Ms. Snyder knows better than to use lazy language such as, ""Me and him..."" and the 3d and final book had entirely too many of those. Each time I read that phrase, it threw me out of the story, and I had to work my way back in. It jarred. The more of them I read, the stronger the jar.Although ""Me and...."" drives me crazy, it may not bother you. Perhaps that is the way you speak and write, and you have no idea it is the epitome of laziness in the use of American English; if so, it won't bother you, and you will probably not even notice.The stories were great fun. I look forward to my next Maria V. Snyder novel. She has a wonderful imagination, and a great ability to create new and interesting worlds.","10 20, 2013",A1O2I3BAX8FXZN,Rainy Day,"Study Hard, Do Your Homework, and Become a Magician",1382227200

Ever since his death, Ethan, Dan's best friend and business partner becomes close to Sophia and her daughter. He is secretly lusting and loving Sophia but is afraid of telling her.  She has become close to Ethan over the last few months.

Sophia was scared of things she was feeling for her husband's best friend.  She needed to escape and decides to go on a cruise by herself to clear her head and be away.

She just needs some time and space to figure out what she wants for the rest of her life, and whether or not her feelings for Ethan are real or just a by-product of their close friendship.Ethan has been waiting for the right opportunity to let Sophia know just how he feels about her.  Having been careful to give her space in which to grieve her late husband, he has bided his time in reluctant patience - he'll be damned if he misses his chance with her now.  Determined to finally make his move and tell the lovely widow just how much she means to him, he moves heaven and earth to land himself on the same cruise.  He'll pull out all the stops to make both of their dreams come true, praying that those dreams will be possible together.Home for Christmas is an absolutely wonderful tale about a mature romance between two friends who have long loved each other from afar.  With a starring couple who are both over forty, Kate Davies offers a realistic look at love the second time around for those of us who are long past the first bloom of youth, but still young enough to entertain dreams of love and forever.As a no-nonsense widow and the mother of a young adult daughter, Sophia is mindful of her family's needs, while still being very aware of her own as a woman.  When the death of her husband left her as part-owner in his business, she never hesitated to roll up her sleeves and work in the family business alongside her friend and partner, Ethan.  She knows Ethan would do anything for her, but worries that her growing romantic ideas about him are born of their close proximity and her dependence on his presence in her life.  While she is ready to admit her feelings, she needs time away to be sure of them before running the risk of damaging their friendship.Of course, Ethan wouldn't be our story's hero if he let her get away with that.  The man is romantically relentless, determined that he won't spend Christmas apart from the woman he loves more than anything.  Even still, he gives her every chance to keep him at arm's length once he arrives on board the cruise ship, while hoping deep down inside that she doesn't take those opportunities.  But Ethan means to make this relationship last for the rest of their lives, and his resolve that Sophia be sure of not just his feelings for her but hers for him are heart-warming.Home for Christmas is a wonderfully inspiring romance that will make readers rejoice in the belief that new life and new love can most certainly happen no matter your age.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**","03 23, 2008",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,4.5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1206230400

Why didn't they look for the other wolf who was with Heather?

It also doesn't have any sex scenes and character development is shallow at best, with the exception of the heroine, Heather.Heather is the human mate to two wolf shapeshifters; when buying supplies, Heather, friend and shapeshifter Niko and her mates' father are ambushed by hunters.  To make a short story shorter, Heather is blamed by her mates who think she was responsible for the attack which ended in their father's death.  She's gravely injured, yet they turn their back on her and leave her to die.  She's rescued by a hunter (a good one this time) who tries to nurse her back to life.What follows is standard typical romance stuff and would be spoilers, if that's possible.  What makes this story very good for me is more about what's left out.  This isn't erotica, despite the steamy books Banks usually writes.  I don't know if it could even be called a romance, since there's not a lot of romancing going on.  It's more of a love story; characters torn apart because of a misunderstanding and brought back together not because of hot sex, but rather love and the ability to forgive.  I didn't particularly like the mates and if it were me, they'd have been kicked back to the pack and I'd have run off with Niko.This isn't a perfect story; things get wrapped up far too soon and because of the length and that fact that nearly all of the narrative focuses on Heather, her mates get the short end of the stick in terms of character development.  They go from feeling betrayed to wallowing in grief because of what they did in a very, very short amount of time.  There are only really five characters and no explanations at all of things like the pack and how Heather came to be with them.Still, this is a nice, sweet story that can be read in an hour.

They will do anything to make it up to Heather and earn her forgiveness, but is it too late?  Has her trust in them been irrevocably broken?Leave it to Maya Banks to have me bawling my eyes out over the Christmas holiday.  With her holiday release, Love Me, Still, Ms. Banks tore my heart to shreds.  Between my past experience with this author's stories and the publisher's synopsis, I really should have expected as much, in hindsight.Never has Maya Banks' ability to instill empathy for her characters in the reader been more evident than in this story.  I felt everything that Heather felt.  I ached when she ached for the loss of her mates.  I sobbed when she cried over the hurt she saw in her mates' eyes when they believed she had betrayed them.  And when they returned to her, I felt the same joy Heather did at her return to the mates and the pack she so cherished.In the midst of all that raw emotion, it never occurred to me what the story didn't have.  It wasn't until later as I reminisced over the story that it struck me - this is the first Maya Banks title I have ever read that has no sex scene.  You read that right - none whatsoever.  And you know what?  As much as I have enjoyed this author's undeniable talent at crafting love scenes that would melt the paint off a car, I didn't even notice it wasn't there while I read the story.  It worked very well without it.  In fact, I would venture so far to say that if adding a sex scene to this story meant cutting any other part of the tale, I would absolutely not want it.  Love Me, Still was that perfect.  If anyone should doubt Maya Banks' writing talent, this story can be held up as a prime example of her ability to stir emotions without needing sex to do so.When I am in the mood for a good tearjerker with a beautiful love story featuring the reuniting of lovers, Love Me, Still will be the book I reach for time and again.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**","03 23, 2008",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1206230400

Scott has been biding his time just waiting for his chance to show Tara they can be more than just friends.  With her recent break-up from her louse of a boyfriend and her subsequent need to show the bum she is serious about the break-up, Scott offers himself up to play the part of her new boyfriend.  Of course, Scott just happens to be into method acting, and this is the role of his lifetime...Tara isn't so sure about Scott's plan - especially when it involves moving in with him, albeit temporarily.  But when his family makes her a business offer that is too good to be true, she can't refuse.  One little problem: how will she ever be able to keep her hands off her hunky friend while living in such close proximity?  Scott could never be interested in a woman like her - could he?Fans of Annmarie McKenna's work will be delighted when they recognize the hero of Look What Santa Brought as the very same Scott Wyatt we first met in her book Blackmailed.  Yes, this is the same Scott that is Brianna's little brother!  Of course, this new story takes place years later and Scott is one very sexy adult man now, ready for his own shot at romance with the woman of his dreams.Scott has certainly grown up right, now running his own business and enjoying life almost to the fullest.  The only thing missing in his life is love.  Sure, his looks pave the way for him with most women, but many regard him as nothing more than a curious fling due to his blindness.  Tara is one of the few women that treats him just like any other man, which he most certainly is.  Despite his disability, Scott is more than capable of taking care of both himself and the woman he loves.Tara is a woman in a situation many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves in at one time of having suddenly found herself in a potentially abusive relationship.  Determined to rid herself of the man trying to control her life and stand on her own, she is at first understandably reluctant to accept Scott's offer to help.  That reluctance only increases as things take a dangerous turn and she is unwilling to put either Scott or his family at risk.  Of course, the valiant Scott is not one to take no for an answer, especially regarding the safety of the woman he has loved for so long.Although a short story, Look What Santa Brought affords us a `where are they now' glimpse into the lives of Scott's sister and her men, reinforcing one happy ever after while delivering another in the form of Scott and Tara's relationship.This sexy little story may have a holiday theme, but Look What Santa Brought is undeniably a story that will be enjoyed by romance fans no matter the time of year.

If I had to put my finger on what was wrong about this book, it would be that there was hardly any back-story to the characters.  The author also relied on conclusive statements that seemed to come out of the blue, rather than letting the characters' motivations and reasoning evolve naturally through the story.It was actually a chore to get myself to finish reading the book, starting from about a third of the way into it.  Not that the first third of the book was any better - that's just how long I would give an author to warm up and hook me into their story.  The sex scenes were too frequent and too long, to the point that the underlying story was never developed in any meaningful way.  It's ebooks like this that make me miss the ability to jump ahead in a paper book, quickly flipping past several pages until I can see where a particularly boring scene has ended and the story picks up again.

I hope you'll also note the publisher's review that implies very mild BDSM and lots and lots of sex.  Don't download this book if you're gonna have a problem with sex on a first date, explicit sexual language and graphic descriptions of sex or people having, you know, sex.To call this a PNR is a stretch because it's way too erotic to be a romance.  And apparently it's not erotic enough to be called erotica for some picky people.  If the rest of the story is only a conveyance to get the couple in bed, in my mind that's erotica even if it's tame.Okay, so now if you're still interested, please get this book!  You won't be disappointed.  This is a straightforward story with a very simple plot.  It's not superior storytelling; I would have liked more character development on both sides, and the dialogue is not great.  But, ultimately, I read erotica so I can get jazzed up and go jump my husband; this book definitely, erm, scored in that regard.  I hate contrived drama between the male and female who could clear everything up if they only talked about their feelings or asked the right question.  The couple in this story had a problem and voila, they talked about it so they could move on to the good part.  What a concept.So, yes, the sex, there's a lot of it.  Just because nobody gets a ball gag in their mouth doesn't mean it's not hot.  The couple connected, had chemistry and the scene where she's doing the monster, holy smoke... well done.","07 18, 2011",AQPZ9T7Q4OPUR,Lorijay,Fun Erotic Read,1310947200

To do this, they need the assistance of some humans in the entertainment industry.  They decide to go with Calypso Productions, but the meeting is a disaster.  In the end, Luke asks one of the women to meet again somewhere else, hoping he can convince her to help in a less formal setting.  The woman, Lena, asks him to dinner.  Though he's nervous--and attracted to Lena--Luke agrees.Lena has risen to a position of influence as a founding member of Calypso Productions.  Together with her three friends, she's one of Hollywood's young elite.  Normally she would blow off a guy who gives a presentation as awkwardly as Luke and his friends did.  Since she finds him attractive, however, she asks him to dinner with the intention of seducing him.  Will Lena still want Luke when she discovers what he and his friends are?Lights, Camera...Monsters is a cute and interesting tale of what happens when an up-and-coming Hollywood businesswoman meets a monster, literally.  Lena is secure in her own place in the world, and proud of her accomplishments.  She's tough and knows what she wants.  Luke, with his mixture of toughness and tenderness, confidence and vulnerability, throws her for a loop.  The scene in which she first sees Luke's true form is really funny.  I liked Luke's navet&eacute; regarding human customs, and his uncertainty.  He softened some of Lena's grating edges.  The storyline itself is engaging, with lots of sex, some action and suspense, and a rather unusual take on the paranormal/monster genre.

1353,B0015Z7VWE,"[1, 4]",1,"I appreciate that the author was trying to go someplace fresh in PNR (goodness knows we've got enough vampires and werewolves out there), but I don't think this book was a success.I really hate romance/erotic novels where the female main character is presented as having an important or high powered career, meets the hero, and then doesn't even think about work for the rest of the book.  The first chapter takes place at work and Lena literally doesn't work for the rest of the book.  The world of work presented here isn't realistic either.  It just doesn't make sense that five college friends, all in their twenties, would be able to set up a super successful Hollywood production company - especially when they rely on their receptionist to set up meetings for them and he does it on the basis of whether or not the guys are cute.  This is far from a minor detail in the book - Lena's job is supposedly how she meets the male main character in the first place.It was disturbing how quickly Lena adopted Luke as a ""pet,"" buying him clothes, telling people to keep their hands off of him, being charmed by his failure to understand human society (and while we're at it, why bother to create a whole new class of beings for your books but then stick with the whole ""he doesn't really understand humans/good sex mates him for life/he is violently possessive"" thing that plagues most PNRs?), and telling her friends (in front of him!) very specific details about how good he is in bed.  I'm so sick of the message that all every woman of minimal accomplishment wants is a guy who will be willing to have slightly deviant sex with her while being so turned on by her that he'll feel compelled to rape her when he even imagines her with another man (which, yes, actually happens here).  While this might not work with an actual woman, Lena is a bit more one-dimensional.  She's sassy!  She's been hurt by men!  She's always on a diet!  She likes mochas!  Her living room is decorated with high heeled shoes and knick knacks from Anthropologie!  She's presumably JUST LIKE YOU or JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WANT TO BE, all she needs is a monster to make her complete (and maybe rape her on the couch!)The plot doesn't really exist other than the sex - there's a flimsy and easily resolved conflict and the rest of the time is spent setting up Lena's beautiful and super cool friends to star in future books.  They're women of accomplishment also, so it should be no time before they realize that their entire life was worthless until they met a macho monster to dominate them.","07 20, 2011",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,Boring,1311120000
1354,B0015Z7VWE,"[1, 2]",4,"I did enjoy this book but it's definitely more about the sex marathons between Lena and Luke than ""the plot"" that could kill them as Luke tries to save his people. The writing was decent and I did like the character of Luke but the story could still use some work. This edition could still use some editing and the author has the annoying tendency of constantly identifying the characters rather than switching to he or she after the first few times. It pulled me out of the story occasionally but it's not a major issue. The sex does tend to go on for a while but there are some definitely hot moments. The whole scene with Luke in his ""monster"" form was pretty ridiculous but it didn't ruin the entire book for me. I got a little confused with all the characters thrown into this story (obviously to set up future books in the series) with 5 best friends including Lena plus Luke and his 2 buddies I couldn't really keep up with who's who when they all got together. There's a small bit of action in the story but Luke's quest to make this movie doesn't actually happen in this story, I'm sure it's going to be prolonged over the course of the series so be warned this is definitely a story about Lena and Luke's relationship or sex life really than anything else. I feel the author missed an opportunity to expand on the life and world of the monsters but overall I liked it for what it was and it's definitely good if your just looking for a little steamy bit of escapist fluff.","07 22, 2011",A1MV7V2HX2PE6Z,Rebekah Rae,More Erotica Than Action Suspense,1311292800

They're hip, trendy, and current, and they're building a stellar name for themselves in the industry by focusing on quality entertainment. She is always on the lookout for promising new clients, but never had that promise held more appeal than when three utterly delicious men walk into the conference room. It may have been the worst sales pitch she'd ever heard, but the apparent front man of the three, a stunningly gorgeous man named Luke, stirs all sorts of juices in Lena. Despite the waste of time the meeting turns out to be professionally, she suggests a further discussion between the two of them that night over dinner.It wouldn't have been difficult for the dinner to go much better than the meeting had, but even Lena is surprised to find out that above and beyond how attractive she finds Luke physically, she is even more entertained by his companionship. Their chemistry is off the charts and the sex is phenomenal. There is, in fact, nothing that could dim the exquisite memory of the best night of her life...until she wakes up, rolls over, opens her eyes, and sees a seven-foot tall, winged, fanged, shaggy monster in bed next to her.That's pretty much when the screaming starts.Convinced some monster had eaten her new lover, Lena is both terrified and pissed, and it takes a hurt and embarrassed Luke a while to calm her down enough to explain that he hadn't been eaten and he is, in fact, a monster. And that he and his friends had come to her company in desperate hope that they could help launch a preemptive campaign to prepare humanity for their existence without sparking panic and causing the relentless slaughter of the last of his kind.Hollywood: gateway to public opinion and recent home to a sex god of a monster. Lena does so love that town.I have to admit, a quick read of the product description of the book before I downloaded it to my Kindle gave me the impression thatLights, Camera...Monstersis a paranormal romance. I should've payed closer attention to the warning, because this is definitely an erotic paranormal romance. It's an important distinction; a fact made crystal clear when I wasn't anticipated it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I like erotic paranormal romance. But in this case, it created a few problems for me.It's not just about the amount of sex in the book, which is a lot, or the level of graphic description, also a lot. Nor is it the light kink, which was fine. It was the fact that all of those things combined and became the largest part of the story by far, substituting romance for sex, eclipsing an anemic external conflict plot thread, providing virtually no character development, and overwhelming the limited world building and mythos creation.The concept of the story is a bit kitschy and kooky, but it is definitely original. The characters were ill-defined and two dimensional, but endearing (especially Luke). There was more than one plot hole, but the guilty pleasure I took in the humor and random bouts of comedy kept me from focusing too heavily on it. And the external conflict was appallingly bereft of development and was so quickly resolved it was laughable, yet...I can't deny that I found it all rather entertaining.I had a hard time believing that the monsters call their species monsters, though. That bothered me a lot, and didn't make a lot of sense in the big picture. They have their own language and their own culture, have hidden themselves away from people, but they define their species based on human preconceptions and labels? That didn't track for me.Yet despite the drawbacks, I found myself oddly drawn in and more than a little captivated by Luke in particular, whose intense efforts to fit in completely charmed me more than once. I wish there had been more time allotted to Luke and Michael and Henry together, because their scenes were showstoppers. And I didn't detest Lena, which is definitely a point in the books favor.In truth, I wish I had started the book with the advanced awareness of its erotic nature, because I think my expectations would have been different and I would have enjoyed the read even more. That being said, I can't complain at the price I paid (gotta love those free Kindle downloads), and don't feel like it was a waste of time. In fact, there was enough promise and potential in DuBois' writing that I'm interested in checking out the rest of the series in the hopes that the smutty, sexual, lightly kinky fun shares the page with a more well-rounded and better conceived plot and fully formed characters.Warning: This book contains graphic scenes of sex and alternative sexual situations including but not limited to: light BDSM, anal sex, and monster sex.

It's not a great story, but it does provide the background to the series, and from what I've heard it is not reflective of the author's usual writing. It's worth reading (esp. for free) if you want the background info. Briefly the prequel tells the story of Kadence, the goddess of oppression, and Geryon the gaurdian of the gate of Hell. It's a short story that tells of their love and their quest to fortify the Gate/wall of Hell as well as the subsequent creation of Pandora's Box. The story is bitter sweet. The ending is a little off (anyone who knows anything about poisionous animals would agree - you'll understand if you read it - but it's paranormal fiction anyway, so whatever.).

This is the story of how/why the dimOuniak (aka Pandora's Box) was created.The Lords of the Underworld series currently has 4 books in the series:The Darkest Night (Lords of the Underworld, Book 1)- Maddox, the keeper of the demon of violence.The Darkest Kiss (Lords of the Underworld, Book 2)- Lucien, keeper of the demon of death and leader of the Budapest warriors.The Darkest Pleasure (Lords of the Underworld, Book 3)- Reyes, the keeper of the demon of pain.This one is available August 2009 -The Darkest Whisper (Lords of the Underworld)- Sabin, the keeper of the demon of doubt and leader of the Greek warriors.","07 1, 2009",A71W7G4TCTH3T,"BBMoreB ""Heather Coulter""",Geryon and Kadence,1246406400

The prologue doesn't necessarily have to be really long or the length of the average book, it should just be long enough to set up everything for the series including the tone of it all.The reader is introduced to the Guardian of Hell-Geyron a beastly grotesque creature, and the Goddess of Oppression- Kadence who is beautiful beyond words.  Both have been stationed by their respective sides to guard and protect the wall into hell.  Kadence is bound to the wall so much so that if it crumbles she will die.  Geyron sold his soul to Lucifer and for that he is positioned to make sure that everything in hell stays there.  Kadence and Geyron have held these positions for centuries and they have never spoken until now.  Even though there were no words passed between them there was a mutual respect and attraction.The wall is beginning to show signs of damage and Kadence has to figure out a way to repair it.  Geyron could not help, even though he desperately wanted to.  In order to save the wall Kadence ended up making a deal with Lucifer, one she would later realize was a mistake.  While trying to repair the wall and take down the Demon Lords, Geyron and Kadence vocalize their feelings, desires, and wants for one another.  This is where it starts to get messy.  The Demon Lords have begun to truly destroy the wall.  Without revealing too much I will say that in the end all the Demon Lords are stuck in Pandora's Box.All in all I really enjoyed this The Darkest Fire.Visit us at Fairytales4grownups.com for the full review and everything Romance Novels like many more reviews and our blog.","04 22, 2012",A1XA42JUD8X134,FairyTales4GrownUps,Fairytales4grownups.com Review,1335052800

Instead it is the story of the origins of the box which originally imprisoned the demons before being intrusted to Pandora.  It is a beauty and the beast style romance between the beastly Guardian of the Gate to the Underworld and the beautiful Goddess of Opression whose strength keeps the walls of the Hell intact and the demons (lust, death, wrath, disease...) from being unleashed on the mortal world. It very much has the same type of feel as P.C. Cast's Goddess of the Rose with the romance between a creature that sees himself as so ugly that doesn't dare to hope that the beauteous object of his affection could see beyond his skin to his noble heart, it also has a similar type of bittersweet happily ever after. I thought that this was a nice little tease to the series before it hit the bookstores, and now that the books are out it's a brief 'just so' historical note to the series, since the box is what got all the Lords into an eternity of trouble.  One caution though to readers, if you find a love between beings of two physically different species uncomfortable, this may not be the story for you.","05 16, 2008",A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7,melindeeloo,3.5 Stars - Prequel to Showalter's Lords of the Underworld,1210896000

1370,B0015Z7WL4,"[2, 2]",3,"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsA semi interesting back-story and I didn't care for the writing style. For some reason I had expected something way more intense since there seems to be so much buzz about the Lords of the Underworld series. To me the writing seemed kind of amateurish. I'm going to give the rest of the books a chance though because I did buy The Darkest Fire as part of a Lords of the Underworld bundle package and I am curious on the relevance of this prequel.Regarding the hero in the story, as admirable as Geryon was, the description of hooves, fur and horns was a big turn off. I just wasn't feeling the draw at all. Even creepy as he seemed more animal than human.The idea that Pandora's box was built from a Goddess' bones was really cool and I think that I may have enjoyed The Darkest Fire more if I had read it after the first book in the series, The Darkest Night. Perhaps I could have appreciated the importance of Pandora's box more. As for the The Darkest Fire being a stand alone little story; I'd not suggest reading it alone and then giving up. More forward with The Darkest Night and then make your decision if you liked it or not. Since I went ahead and read The Darkest Night right away, that moved my rating for this book from a 2 to a 3.

The wall has a crack in it and Kadence bargains with Lucifer to allow Geryon to help her repair it.

The Earl of Vailmont doesn't believe the rumors, however, and is determined to prove his theory that there is no magic involved. In typical rouge fashion, he sets out to show his friends that he can associate with women without getting caught. Unfortunately, he chooses Sylvia to experiment with and becomes attracted to her. This pits Val against Sylvia in a game of pursuit as old as time.You can read this for the fun, surface story of magical love potions, lusty protagonists, and fears of marriage and really enjoy this book. You can also read this for the underlying story where both Val and Sylvia have suffered  great losses--loss that has always stood in the way of true happiness and finding love. Though they each approach their losses--betrayal, moral dilemmas, death, in different ways it is that approach and that desire to find love that is for me the real conflict in this story and what puts it above many others in this genre.","11 28, 2010",A1PMYWK6CVJJNI,MaggieMae,Rogues Get Caught,1290902400

And along with this hot sexiness, the author also gives us a sweet romance.So you know the main story- girl wins lottery and falls for her financial planner. What you don't know is that the girl is afraid to love. I won't tell you why specifically, but she does have reasons for how she feels about love, relationships, and men in general. Her motto is keep things clean and neat and no one gets hurt.Brittney treats men as disposable playthings. She owns her sexuality and has no qualms about having fun, hot sex flings. Because of her past, Brittney's relationships with men are more hormonal rather than emotional. She reduces them to basic need; there is no love or tenderness, no expectation of tomorrow. She does not date and does not know what a 'normal' relationship with a man would even look like.Enter our hero, Charlie, who is nice, normal, solid and hot as hell. I'd call him a sexy geek. He's a tall, fit number cruncher with dark hair and eyes and these cute wire-rimmed glasses. And Brittney drives him crazy. They are so opposite, but the attraction between them builds and builds. Without really understanding the why or how of this sexual chemistry between them, they decide to let the attraction play out, but only as a quickie here and there.This is more at Brittney's insistence. She's so afraid to feel anything but lust for a man. Mention love and she's out the door. But poor Charlie, he's a man ready for a commitment, for happily ever after. He wants a woman to take care of and to spend the rest of his life with. And he's determined to make Brittney see things his way.I just loved Charlie! Even that solid, stand-by-you name of his. Every woman deserves a Charlie. I could just kiss him. He is so patient with Brittney. He really gentles her, quiets her fears, and treats her like something special.And let's not forget that hot sex. Sex in the office, sex in a public restroom, more sex in the office, and then lastly, a very tender but sexy scene as love words are finally confessed.This is a novella, but it is packed with a sweet love story and some HOT sex. I really enjoyed it; I loved both characters a lot. Brittney thinks to seduce Charlie into a fast, no strings affair, but it is Charlie who seduces Brittney into accepting the love of one good, true man.There are books about Britt's two best friends as well-Book 2Fortune's Promise: : Fortune, Book 2Book 3Fortune's Chance: : Fortune, Book 3","05 26, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S.

1414,B0016IXMCI,"[8, 8]",5,"Under advisement of her editor, romance author Julia Martin is about to embark on a new venture - writing erotic romances.  Unfortunately she doesn't have any experience in anything but vanilla (and even that was a very long time ago).  The erotic books her editor Ross leant her have her imagination in overdrive and him starring as the hero in every single fantasy.Over the past decade she's locked herself away from the world with only her cat Duke for company - and of course the Thursday night pizza date with Ross.  Two months ago her beloved companion Duke passed away leaving her depressed, lonely and in a funk that she's been unable to shake.  Ross suggested she make a major change in her life and offered his cabin in West Virginia as an escape.  That it's January, the dead of winter and it's snowing with no signs of letting up is a little disconcerting.  In New York when the doldrums set in she could head out to be around other human beings.  She'll be staying in this cabin for months and being snowed in isn't a thought she relishes.Ross Philips has been Julia's best friend and editor for the past decade and over the past several years discovered that his feelings for her go much deeper.  He's afraid she wouldn't be able to handle his strong sexual appetites so he's kept his attraction to her a secret and dated a bevy of beauties, which Julia refers to as ""The Miss America brigade.""  Since the death of Duke, she's stopped writing and sunk into a depression which entices Ross to tempt her into making some major changes in her life and hopefully a big part of those changes will involve the two of them and tangled sheets.Julia thinks she'll be at the cabin all alone until Ross arrives bringing supplies and a few other odds and ends. While she's certainly happy to see him the reason for his arrival isn't at all clear.  She's not really buying that he came out there concerned for her well being because of the snowstorm but what other possible reason could he have?  It's not until he questions her about her ideals for her erotic book that things take a shocking turn.  Ross volunteers to help her with her erotic research and he's fully prepared to introduce her to all sorts of wickedly exciting ideas.  Julia isn't at all convinced that he'd truly want her - more than likely she's just convenient - but Ross isn't going to give up and being snowed in with him will allow them time to get to know each other much, much better.  What will happen when their time together at the cabin comes to an end though?EROTIC RESEARCH is Mari Carr's first published work and I must say she delivers a delightfully satisfying read.  I found it very easy to empathize with Julia and her self preservation by hiding away from the world.  Ross is a wonderfully caring man who has spent the past decade getting to know Julia and treasures their friendship - even while knowing that he desires much more from her.  Ms. Carr doesn't skimp on any of the research `techniques' and I must say Julia is a very willing subject. This is a delightful read that combines plenty of red hot sex, emotional angst, some soul searching and best of all a lasting love that develops from a genuine friendship.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","02 21, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

1418,B0016IXMCI,"[3, 3]",2,"From what I understand, this is Mari Carr's first published piece and frankly, it kind of reads that way. I liked the two main characters and enjoyed their connection, plus there were some places with decent chemistry and sizzle. Overall though, it all felt very inconsistent. At some points Ross seems very alpha, at others we're told he's alpha but really see no evidence of that.The beginning of their sexual relationship felt a little awkward, with them running hot and cold and bouncing around back and forth on what they understand their relationship to be. The whole thing felt choppy, the love scenes short, jumping from one to another, then skipping a few days, etc. There were only a few lines in each scene that started to make me feel hot and bothered, and then it would sizzle away. It sometimes seemed like the ingredients were there, but for some reason they didn't come together as they should and it ended up feeling ... flat.One *HUGE* complaint I have: They start off almost at the beginning with role-playing - and role-playing in which Julia is a captive or sex slave, i.e. she's supposed to be somewhat resisting. While resistance is not a big part of the role-playing, it's still present, so I found it extremely disturbing that there was no safe word and they didn't lay down any rules or understandings beforehand.As I said before, I liked Julia and Ross and really enjoyed their friendship and the dialogue back-and-forth between them. I think the story could have turned out far better if that part had been more heavily explored and the sexual component of their relationship slowly integrated in. A really fantastic example of this that I read recently was Claire Matthews'Intimate Friends. That novella is even shorter, so the length constraint is greater and they start sleeping together pretty early on, however it felt much smoother and worked far better than in this case.ROMANCE NOVELLA RECOMMENDATIONS:*Intimate Friendsby Claire Matthews (4.5 stars)*Hearts In Darknessby Laura Kaye (4.5 stars)*Willing Victimby Cara McKenna (4 stars)","08 19, 2011",A2AEGAEODIRX75,J.

Fortunately, she's not a weepy, woe-is-me kind of girl.  It's obvious that she's scared and just when it seems that her situation can't be much worse, she becomes the focus of a disagreement amongst the gang.Cal Riker was horrified when he saw Norton pull the beautiful woman from the train.  He may be running with the gang of outlaws but he isn't truly one of them.  Rather than let them take turns raping her, Cal offers his share of the profits in exchange for her.  If there's any hope of his saving her from their lecherous intents then he'll have to make them believe he wants her all to himself.Laurel's shocked to learn that Cal is the legendary killer she's heard so much about but his actions aren't what she'd expect of a ruthless man.  It would have been simple for him to take advantage of her but instead he protects her and insists that he'll deliver her safely to her family.Laurel quickly realizes that she's extremely attracted to Cal and for the first time in her life she's willing to put her heart on the line. Cal tries to play a tough-as-nails outlaw but there's a softer side to him.  They spend a lot of time alone together after leaving the gang and neither of them regrets it when they become lovers.  Cal assumes that their time together will come to an end when she returns home.  Laurel has other ideas.  She's determined to make a life with him and with her family's influence she's sure that it's a possibility.  Is there any hope that he can escape his past and become the model citizen she's sure he can be?Emma Wildes tells awesome historical tales and this story is a prime example of why she's an author on my auto buy list.

Laurel is a spunky character who's found herself in a difficult situation that would have reduced most women to tearful begging.  Cal is an honorable man who does what he believes is right - and it's cost him the sort of life that he should have lived.

""Babylonian Laws,"" which most of us were (I am not sure if this is still the case) exposed to in Junior High, or at the very latest, in High School, are of course more popularly known as ""The Code of Hammurabi"" and are the oldest known (I stress ""known"") laws we presently have access to.This copy, which was published in or around 1903 by C.H.W. Johns (1857 - 1920) contains all the know elements of this code.  Some of the material here is rather fragmented and much has been lost down through the ages.  After all, this work was created around B.C. 2285 - 2242.In this particular work we are given a very nice forward by C.H.W. Johns who was an Assyriologist and Church of England Clergyman.  Johns has quite a number of academic papers under his belt, this being one of them.After the introduction the actual code, or what we know if it, is recorded in all of its known sections.  I personally found this to be an interesting read.  I must admit to having never read the Code in its entirety before and this gave me a golden opportunity to do so.The reader will find that almost all aspects of society at that time were covered.  Quite a number of the situations found during those times no longer exists, but on the other hand many do and for me it is interesting to note that mankind has not changed all that much down through the ages.It is of particular note the various punishments required for infractions of many of these laws.  I covered the first 15 or so pages and I fear to tell you that had I lived at that time my life would have been rather short due to the fact that the death penalty seemed to be the main form of punishment...with drowning and burning being at the top of the list as to methodology.These laws, while quite primitive in our eyes, covered trade, marriage,  slave ownership, concubine management, farming, trade, social interaction and on and on.This is not a good forum to discuss all of these laws item by item as a large number of volumes have been published down through the years addressing this code and most have easy access to these works - if of course, there is interest.For those that are familiar with our current laws (those that possess a far greater understanding than I care to have) will be fascinated as to how this Code has influenced the laws of various societies down through the years.This, as I said, is a free down load and it is a most worthwhile download.  This is a part of our history ergo, we all need to be at least somewhat familiar with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks","03 23, 2012",A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,D.

Numerous specific crimes are mentioned, along with very specific punishments. Most of the crimes revolve around things dealing with farming, buying and selling things, and debts.Punishments ranged from paying a fine (in money or goods/animals), to somewhat much more severe, like having a hand cut off, all the way to death. Some of the things I found most interesting are as follows:Threaten a witness? You die.Judge makes a mistake in giving the penality? Out of a job.Steal. Depends who you steal from. If you're rich, you pay 30 times the amount stolen; if poor, you pay ten times the amount stolen. The laws seemed to be fairly balanced in this way, the penalty in money or goods higher for the rich person than for a poor person.If a woman opens a wine house? She dies.If a wife has sex with some other guy and is caught, they are tied together and drowned.If a wife is very ill, the guy can take another wife but must still take care of the first one.If a son has sex with his mother and they are caught, both are burnred to death.If a son strikes a father, one of his hands is cut off.If a guy causes another guy to lose an eye or break a limb, the same will be done to him.If a guy hits a pregnant woman and she dies, thus losing the baby, then, if the guy has a daughter, she dies.There's also a whole section on the fees various people can charge, including doctors, vets, house builders and ship builders.All-in-all a very harsh system of laws, but in some ways, especially the rich paying a much stiffer penalty than the poor, most fair than today's laws.","08 2, 2013",A1NDYD4JKKY9LE,"Sarah Marie ""sarah_marie""",Harsh laws but some fair points,1375401600

At the age of 19, she has given up any real hope of happiness for herself, but not for Emily. When events on the wagon train leave the 2 girls alone and penniless, Sarah finds herself in a very precarious situation.Roy strikes gold when he arranges for Sarah to be Cal's birthday present. Roy's brother Cal is a decent man who has not found personal happiness and after initial reluctance finds himself drawn to Sarah. She gives him a joy that he no longer anticipated in his life and he gives her a sense of belonging and importance that she did not dare hope for.There are many sweet moments, also involving Roy and little Emily, the mother of the 2 brothers who is confined to a wheelchair after a stroke and a romance between Ned and the schoolteacher.Several malicious, cruel and scheming characters keep the drama moving through to the end.The language was a bit clich&eacute;d in places, but the characters are very likeable and the plot maintains its pace throughout.I will definitely read the next two books in this series.Untamed Hearts (Easton Hearts Series #2)Undaunted Hearts (Easton Hearts Series #3)","03 22, 2011",A1Y6G4Y3P8AQZC,LaylaReader,Western romance,1300752000

And like several of the books in this series, the style is a little more serious than most of her other stuff I've read.It was a good story, but not a traditional romance. The heroine survived a horrid childhood by becoming a tough a**. This isn't just talk, a character description that really has no bearing on the boy-meets-girl plot. She lives the life: collects martial arts black belts, participates in war games, only has one female friend, etc. She also has a series of jobs (that we only hear about, don't really see) that can be dangerous, even violent. Her initial interest in the hero is because he is better than she is at fighting, and she wants him to teach her.There was just one thing that bothered me. From the start, the hero recognized that he had to keep the heroine off balance to hold her attention. So, all their interactions for most of the book were studied on his part. In one scene, for instance, he doesn't compliment her on her appearance when first he sees her, because she would be expecting it. He does so later in the evening, when it's a surprise. This might seem minor, but how honest is he in their getting to know each other, when all his actions and conversation are geared to unsettling her?It's different, but well done.","07 4, 2011",AGTF8KS70RHCW,Terracotta Dove,"Good Read, Different Flavor",1309737600

He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries.

1491,B0017Y914Y,"[53, 53]",5,"I was born not long after the end of World War II.  Some of my earliest memories are of hiding under the table out on my Grandma's porch listening to my Dad and all of my uncles talk about their experiences during the war.  World War II, and in particular the Holocaust, has always held a fascination (for want of a better word) for me. I've read countless books on the subject, watched dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours of movies and documentaries, and even had a chance to see & hear about some of what happened first hand both here at home and living in Germany.In general, I do not approve of fiction when it comes to the Holocaust.  Let me tell you why.  This is an event that must never be forgotten, an event that some (all too many) deny ever happened, even with many survivors and combatants on both sides still alive. So, when I hear about something like ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", first presented as a real event, then later declared to be a complete fiction by the authors themselves, I cringe.  It will not be long before all of the direct witnesses have passed.  Even my generation, the ones who heard the stories first hand, who saw the tattoos, who have walked the remnants of the battlegrounds, are getting on up there. Before too long, there will be nothing to witness except words written in a book.  Those words must be truth, not fantasy.  Otherwise, in 25 or 30 or 40 years people can simply point to a stack of made up books and say ""see - all fiction - never happened.""There are some cases, though, where a story is important to tell even if it must be told through the medium of fiction because there are no longer living witnesses - or perhaps never were.  One of those stories is the roundup,subsequent abandonment and final shipment to Auschwitz of more than 4,000 children in the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris, an action carried out by the French police on Petain's orders.  There were few survivors - a mere handful - and most of those were young children at the time.  Tatiana de Rosney does an excellent job of telling the story of this horrific event inSarah's Key.Until very recently even the fact that there WERE Jewish partisans was not particularly well known, at least not in popular mediums.  Leon Uris talks about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inExodus.  Rudi Weiss joins the Jewish partisans inHolocaust.  Only in the last few years has the story of the Bielski Brothers -The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 JewsandDefiance- truly documented the Jewish Resistance.  As heroic as the Bielskis were, their group was not the only Jewish resistance group. It is vitally important that a couple of decades from now, when all who were there to witness or spoke to those who witnessed are gone, that people know that everyone did not march quietly to the slaughter like so many sheep, that the Bielskis were neither alone in their resistance nor an aberration. There is room in the historical record forThe Remnant - Stories of the Jewish Resistance in WWII.Othniel Seiden's story has its foundations in a great deal of research - interviews, records of the Nuremberg proceedings, diaries left behind by those who lived these events - and he has done a remarkable job of presenting characters that are accurate & compelling composites.Some have commented negatively on his portrayal of the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Hitler's Final Solution, particularly as regards the Pope in office at the time of World War II, a role that has been the subject of great debate over the years, debate that is not yet entirely settled.  The basic facts that Seiden addresses in this regard - that the Catholic Church had a pact with Hitler and that the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Europe at the end of World War II - are grounded in known, demonstrable facts.  It is only since the papacy of Pope John Paul II, himself a Polish seminary student during World War II, that there has been some attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of Pope Pius XII regarding his actions towards the Nazis and the ""Final Solution."" Had Seiden chosen to present this rehabilitative material, information that would have been unknown to the characters at the time during which these events occurred, would be to rewrite history.  That would be a grave error.Highly recommended.  This is worth your time to read.","02 6, 2012",A2WZNM833CJH82,Grandma,Worth your time to read!,1328486400

I expect to feel disgust, anger and sadness when reading accounts of the Holocaust-what I didn't expect was how this book made me examine myself, and analyze what I believe in my heart...I am struggling to put into words what I am feeling, but I will try...Sol makes the point when talking to the priest that Christians have been taught from birth that the only way is through Christ, and they are all anti-Semitic, even if sub-consciously... I consider myself a Christian, but was not raised in any particular ""religion""- as a result, I only have the Bible to go on, where it is repeatedly said that the Jews are Gods Chosen people... I can't imagine that has changed. God is not fickle. Is God going to refuse the Jewish people, who also love and serve Him? If I thought that were possible than maybe He isn't a God I want to serve...As long as anyone is condemning someone else for having a different belief system than their own, we are doomed to repeat history. There are many paths to God. It makes me cringe when any one religion claims theirs' is the ONLY way. We need to embrace each other, as equal children of God, and remember that the Greatest Commandment is LOVE. Who are we to judge another?I highly recommend this book.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades. What should have been a day or two read, turned into almost a week because I had to keep stopping and looking things up; I have over two pages of notes on events and people and rumors that I had to chase down. And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it.

She doesn't get very far and when she's caught by Luke and Gabe, Jules is taken to their home and claimed.  The mating will come later once she accepts her position.  Time is not on their side, however, because Luke and Gabe aren't the only lions wanting Jules.  Now they must accept a mating challenge with the hope that they will be the victors.Claiming Their Mate was a great book!  I loved how Luke and Gabe could sense Jules' thoughts and feelings and did their best to make her comfortable in her new home.  Jules' temperament often seemed off to me--I wanted her to care for the brothers as much as I could tell they cared for her. But, despite that, I enjoyed the foray in the White Sands Pride of lions.  Claiming Their Mate was sensual and highly charged.  It was a well written m&eacute;nage that was almost innocent in its sensuality because of the lack of a certain sexual position shown in most m&eacute;nage stories.  The ending was sublime, although it seemed a bit cut off because I would have loved to have seen Luke, Jules, and Gabe at home in their own bed loving each other.  However, that wasn't enough to keep me from reading another book by Paige McKellan.  She is on my radar now, and I can't wait to read more of her work!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","05 16, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Claiming Their Mate,1210896000

Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: This little book  is #1 of the paranormal romance/erotica series ""Cougar Falls"" that features a variety of shifters. There is really only one thing that will influence how much you will enjoy this book- assuming you generally enjoy this genre in the first place: Would you find a m&eacute;nage encounter between one sexy lady and three hot brothers erotic? That is the only question to ask yourself. If you find your curiosity piqued or you KNOW you would, then read this. If not, then move on to something else.Reading order in the series:Rachel's TotemIn Plain SightFoxy LadyCHARACTERS: All these characters are sweet and sexy. It's a quirky little town with quirky people. This is a FAST read, so not a lot of development. I was actually surprised at how well the entire town was depicted in such a short book. While no one was fully developed, I got a good sense of the character of the place.PLOT: Again, this is a novella in a genre known for keeping things simple. Not a big plot line here- but for what it is, it's well done. It is definitely more creative than most I've read and opens up a world of possibilities for future books. All told, brilliant execution through simplicity.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended if you are up for some erotically messy f/m/m/m- no BSDM or m/m.

(Novella sized).- m/f with a 1f:3m experience. Explicit, sometimes Dominant (authoritative). No m/m (brothers).

In ""Rachel's Totem"" our Heroes are catamount (puma) shifters, but we meet a raptor, a bear, some foxes, and some wolves. The humans are expected to take on some of their animals traits (the foxes are ""sly"", for example), and so the shifting aspects become integral to the story line. It's an interesting take on the Shifter World, and set up well in this first novella of the series.""Rachel's Totem"" as a whole is a good book. It's solid. The erotic scenes are heated, including a menage required to bring her animal to the fore, but they perhaps aren't as well-developed as others of the genre. What it has going for it is an interesting World Premise. A Small Shifter Town with Bad Wolves on the horizon and Native American Magic playing a bass line. How these sub-plots will play out in future books is yet to be seen, but right now it gives the series Promise.3.5 stars rounded up. It needed more character depth, and I'm not convinced on the menage scenes.

Characters are not very deep, but still appealing. Magic is understated with the emphasis on the dual nature of the shifters and the significance of finding a mate. This is a fast read- what you see is what you get. Nothing too intense.PLOT: Very basic. This is a subgenre that traditionally doesn't have complicated plotlines and this one doesn't stray far from the norm. Still, it does what it is supposed to. This is a NOVELLA, so be prepared for things to move a little faster than is reasonable. There isn't much adjustment time for Max to court Emma, Emma to accept the idea of shifters and becoming one and the plot to resolve itself. It would have been better if there was more to it. One complaint, the ""claiming"" was completely unreasonable in its suddenness and lack of explanation- and then the response was disproportionately low.CHARACTERS: Like watching an episode of ""Friends,"" this story presents a few fun personalities with a little history and plenty of potential for ongoing mischief. Max seems like a genuinely nice, well rounded guy, if a little self-centered. Emma is a spunky, full-figured chick. Her virgin state was a little too far-fetched for me and, frankly, I'm getting a little annoyed with the prevalence of this particular point in para-romance. Maybe there are more virgins out there than I thought...BOTTOM LINE: This is perfect if you are in the mood for a little shifter fun.

Very little reaction was shown to something that was really a pretty big life altering discovery. They didn't seem to care that these guys turned them into werecats.

1557,B001892DGG,"[0, 0]",5,"Originally posted at: [...]If you enjoy paranormal romances with funny quips, sassy mates and well developed characters then The Wallflower will be a treat.Emma is a hot ticket. Maybe she used to be a wallflower in high school but those days are long behind her. Well, they should be but there's this one babe who is a thorn in her side. I found Emma's response to the witch as one I could respect and very classy. She now gives as good as she gets and I enjoyed every minute of it. Some people are inherently nasty and never seem to grow up, so the secondary character that plagues Emma is a great personality to showcase the inner strength that Emma now has.And the part where she was snarling at Max, the way that whole scene was written had me grinning ear to ear. I could visualize it in my head and I would adore seeing that on the big screen. Even at her most grouchy, it was still romantic.Max is the alpha and a very interesting man. Ms. Bell's choice of scene for Max's introduction to Emma was classic and quite fun. It had a real presence to it, a fullness that resonated with me and hooked me.He's a classic kind of character, full of take charge genes that demand capitulation from those he is in charge of. When Emma stands up to him, the resulting reaction is everything I could wish in a man who becomes besotted with his future mate, and the hunt is on. What fun. I loved Max's strength, and so did Emma.One of the main things that hooked me about this story was the dialogue. When Emma called Max `Captain Caveman', it gave me the giggles. She has all these cute references to kitty litter and jokes about shifters in general that it gave me a good feeling about Emma's persona. She's a character that I'd like to know for real. Max's reaction to some of what she says is equally fun and enjoyable to read. He takes his role as alpha seriously but he knows how to have a good time as well, and his sense of humor compliments Emma. Ms. Bell must have a delightful sense of humor of her own, because this story is warm and loving even when the tension is high.The sensual and sexual tension is wonderfully built up and delivered. I have said it before in my reviews of paranormal romances and I'll say it again - I adore a good bite scene and this tale delivered splendidly. It was erotic, titillating and very satisfying. Another thing I appreciated was Ms. Bell's handling of Emma's reaction to the big revelation. This story was so well balanced, it made me feel good during and after my reading of it.The secondary characters each play a vital role in helping a reader understand the main personalities in the tale, or they contributed to the plot movement. Everyone was there for a reason and it was believable. The story is told in both Max's and Emma's points of view with a perfect balance to keep me interested and involved. The conflict is mostly external but it tweaked a few internal issues as well. I think this book was written with a fine balance between an involved and fleshed out storyline and the amount of sexual escapades between the hero and heroine. It satisfied my mind and my libido.The Wallflower is a book not to miss for readers who are looking for a hero and heroine who can make them smile, sigh and outright laugh. It's a vibrant and rich world of likeable characters and an interesting courtship between a hunky eye doctor and an adorably sassy shop owner. I had so much fun reading this book that I simply have to find more by Ms. Bell. Her writing is becoming an addiction I can't wait to indulge more in. I absolutely recommend reading this impish and delightfully saucy book.","09 10, 2010",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...",One for the Keeper Shelf,1284076800

At times the men even talked like girls. There was a part in the story when Emma called Max(the hero) a girl and agreed.So other than the high school drama kind of feel and the men sounding more like women at times (ex. one of the male characters described a pushy female as a 'stanky ho'), I liked the story.

1585,B001892DIO,"[2, 2]",2,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 4/10PROS:- The story is filled with glamorous surroundings and people who are fun to read about. Who's not interested, on at least some level, in famous twin brothers who make People's 50 Most Beautiful People list, frequent A-list clubs, and stay in the executive suites of fancy hotels?- I liked Kasey's brother, Garrett, quite a bit. He's flashy and flamboyant with a ""devil take it"" attitude, yet he also knows when to be serious and is very protective of his twin.- Gram has a pretty serious thing for Kasey from the start of the story, and I thought it was cute that although Gram thinks he has hidden his attraction so well, so many of his employees and friends know about it and encourage it.CONS:- I couldn't help rolling my eyes at some of the melodramatic--and unrealistic--things the characters do. Kasey, who's not out in public, wakes up on the couch of a night club and immediately twines his fingers with Gram's...then lets Gram kiss him? Gram starts calling Kasey ""baby"" after their first sexual encounter? Kasey gives an impassioned coming out speech to a whole slew of reporters not 20 minutes after having said he wasn't going to tell anyone outright?- There's practically no buildup, emotional or physical, to the first sex scene, and because there's so little development between sex scenes, they left me cold. They're lovingly described in rather minute detail, but I found them a little clinical. They have a removed, play-by-play feel to them.- Some of the dialogue is wooden-sounding and is used to awkwardly convey plot points that would have been better placed in the exposition. For example, Kasey says this while talking to Garrett at the beginning of the story: ""Add to the fact your twin brother is a starting point guard on a pro basketball team and you're a tabloid reporter's wet dream."" There's some important background information here, but it just doesn't sound natural in dialogue.- There are numerous ""duh"" instances throughout the story where the writing needlessly repeats itself. Here's one: ""Kasey weighed in at around two hundred pounds. At one hundred and eighty pounds, Garrett was several pounds lighter.""Overall comments: I like the idea of this story: the setting is alluring, and there are several interesting minor characters with dramatic comings and goings that read rather like a soap opera. However, the story very much focuses on the sex scenes; and since I didn't find them particularly titillating, the entire novella fell flat for me.","08 5, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T.

1587,B001892DIO,"[1, 1]",5,"One thing you could say of T.A. Chase's books is that they are all very different. This one is a sexual romp (from Merriam Webster Online romp = a: high-spirited, carefree, and boisterous play b: something suggestive of such play: as (1): a light fast-paced narrative, dramatic, or musical work usually in a comic mood (2): an episode of lovemaking).Kasey is a 23 years old pro basketball player. He is only in his second year as professional player and he has no courage to openly admit that he is gay. He is out with his family and friends, but not with the public opinion. Plus his twin brother Garrett, a famous actor, has made coming out some years ago and now all media are only waiting for him to make the same claim.But Kasey till now has never had a boyfriend to care and he doesn't see the reason to suffer all the harrassment he will receive in the locker room if he makes that claim. That is, but now in Kasey's life enters Gram, a night club owner and an openly gay man who had bad experiences in the past with closeted lovers.Kasey must decide if he is willing to risk his career to keep his lover by his side.The story is not very long, less than 90 pages, but it's very erotic. From the first time Kasey and Gram have a very intense relationship and they are driven by lust most of the time. Since Kasey is a 23 years old guy that for sometime was deprived of a sexual partner, I think it's not strange that now that he can have someone near him, he is in frenzy to make up for the lost time. Plus it was a true discovery that Kasey is a totally bottom. I'm used to sports characters to be always very manly, even if gay, and usually they are totally top. Instead Kasey wants to be mastered, even if he is a pushy bottom.The main characters don't interact a lot with the supporting characters, but there are some interesting figures: Garrett, Kasey's brother, Paul, Kasey's teammate, but also Bo, Gram's employee and Colville, another pro basketball player. Since this is the first book in a series, I think we will have the chance to read something on one or plus of these characters.","04 25, 2008",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Out of Bounds (Love of Sports 1) by T.A.

Both are gay, Garrett is out but Kasey isn't. As the story opens, Kasey is back from an out-of-town game, and Garrett wants him to go out to a local club with him - Garrett has just broken up with his long-term partner and wants to go have fun.Ingram (Gram) Fletcher owns the Liverpool, the club near Kasey's home. Gram has had his eye on Kasey forever, but doesn't know if Kasey is straight or gay so he hasn't made a move. When Garrett and Kasey get to the club, one of their friends casually mentions to Gram that Kasey's in the back of the club and hints that Kasey might not rebuff advances from Gram. Then Garrett hints at the same thing. Deciding to take a chance, he heads over to see Kasey, and makes his move...and is rewarded with an enthusiastic response from Kasey.Kasey and Gram decide to get together again, and begin dating. Since Kasey is ""in"" and Gram is ""out"", it does make things a bit difficult. Kasey can't afford a hint of of the truth getting out as the sports world is nowhere near as accepting as Hollywood is, and rumors already swirl about Kasey's sexuality due to his twin being openly gay.When Kasey and Grant get together for a weekend in New Orleans, things don't go as planned and Kasey has to take a stand...My thoughts: First of all, you know I'm a sucker for any book that takes place in part or whole in New Orleans :) I really did enjoy Out of Bounds though. Kasey was a sympathetic character (I seem to always sympathize with the ones in the closet, I guess, lol) and Gram was understanding of his situation. I find in a lot of the M/M stories the partner that is openly gay gets frustrated with the partner that is not; that Gram wasn't pushing Kasey was a refreshing change.I had a bit of trouble with the opening scene - Kasey is very closeted and when Gram approached him in the club they started making out in public. I found that hard to believe, even if they were in the back of the VIP area. Except for that scene, though, I thought TA Chase did a great job with describing the setting and characters, and I could picture the events unfolding in my mind as I read along. Kasey's homophobic teammates were hateful and I was glad he also had supportive teammates in the locker room.I'm looking forward to reading his brother Garrett's story next - High Line.","04 1, 2011",A76OB6E2II5KS,"Loves FAB Romance ""Introvert, Worrier,  & res...",Out of Bounds,1301616000

It was a promise that wasn't really fulfilled.After that there's a lot of sex and the plot (young sport star who has to decide whether to stay in the closet and keep his endorsements or to come out and face the consequences with his teammates and fans) is lost in the bedroom. We don't really know the two characters and especially Gram is rather flat.There are no real problems in the book and it is a fast and hot read, but it seems incomplete and rushed at the end, like a collection of little episodes, but nothing really tying them together.","01 25, 2011",A1RXR105ND8OSH,manutwo,An unfulfilled promise,1295913600

She couldn't believe her husbands (yes plural) Logan Wellesly and Rhys Cullen had stood her up again.  The night she was going to share the news that they were going to be parents.  To make matters worse when they did call, instead of apologizing for standing her up, they were canceling the 2 week vacation they had planned.  She was tired of pretending that their marriage wasn't a mess; she thought this vacation was their last chance to get it back on track - and they canceled.  So she was going without them...she figured they wouldn't even notice that she was gone.Two days after she arrived in Jamaica, Rhys finds her dancing in a club.  He takes her back to his hotel room, where a few minutes later Logan shows up, and he seems surprised that she left without a note or phone call.  They proceed to make it up to her - then business gets in the way again.  They run off again...she returns home, where they are going to meet her and surprise...surprise they had a change of plans.They should have put as much effort into their marriage as they did in trying to get the hotel contract.  I suppose it has a HEA.I have to say I felt bad for Catherine through the entire story.  I also have to say that Logan and Rhys are a couple of Ba****ds.

Her husbands have been taking her for granted and over the past several months have blown off every date she's set up.  She wholeheartedly loves them but nurturing their relationship has fallen by the wayside in their course to better their business.  It's their five year anniversary and she has some very exciting news but their neglect has her questioning if she should stay or kiss them goodbye.Logan and Rhys have invested a year's worth of time in securing the biggest contract of their business career.  Unfortunately the client keeps jerking them around.  In their determination to make more money they've lost sight of what's truly important - their unique relationship with Cat.  They soon realize that their drive for success could quite possibly cost them the love of their lives.It's been three months since Cat was last intimate with Logan and Rhys.  They've been too wrapped up in their business ventures to pay her much attention and she's sunk into a pit of despair and loneliness.  The men completely forgot about their anniversary dinner and then canceling out on their Jamaican vacation is just too much.  She's played second best for far too long.  Cat has every intention of going on this vacation - with or without them.  It will give her a chance to relax and reevaluate her situation.  What she doesn't expect is for her unexpected absence from their home to open Logan and Rhys eyes to the possibility of a life without her.  Logan and Rhys have made a success of their business but their marriage is on the verge of failure.  Will they find a way to balance the two or is it already too late to rectify the wrongs they've done to Cat?If you think being in a menage a trois relationship means that you'd never feel neglected or taken for granted then you're wrong.  In Maya Banks STAY WITH ME, Cat, Logan and Rhys are forced to face the fact they're all to blame for the break down in their marriage.  Cat's been too compliant and never voiced her unhappiness.  Logan and Rhys are so career driven that they didn't realize that they were hurting her by not being more attentive.  If their marriage is going to succeed they're all going to have to put each other first, but can the men really delegate their business to office hours only?Maya Banks has become one of my favorite authors because of her emotionally driven storylines.  In STAY WITH ME readers will be drawn into the story and come to really care about the characters and maybe even live vicariously through them.  Who wouldn't like to have two sexy men doing everything in their power to make sure you don't leave them?

Instead of coming in on the part of the couple's story when their relationship was just starting we come in on the middle where it's on the verge of ending.I'm beginning to wonder if maybe I expect too much from my taboo or erotic reads.  For a romance I expect likable characters for the leads, characters that even if I don't agree with what they do that at the least I'll understand why. Both of those factors were missing in this book.  Logan the alpha male in the threesome was all alpha and not at all likable.  Usually I am the first one to jump up and root for an alpha male, but in this case there were very few redeemable qualities to be found in Logan.  As a reader you understand Catherine loves him, but why?  Rhys was better than Logan in that at least he was likable, but that was it.  There was nothing wonderful about him.To me the story would have been better if Catherine had stuck to her resolve even once,  made them really work for something. It just seemed that at every turn Catherine was giving in and going along with what they wanted.  In the end I found myself  just skimming the last few chapters. I'd recommend skipping this one.Stats:Ebook pages: 118 of actually storyGenre:  erotic, menage romanceRe-Readablitiy: NoneSteam Factor: Hot","03 4, 2012",A1CW6U1Y2PGVWS,"C.

I was looking forward to this book mainly because I usually love Maya Banks's style. But I found myself having to push through parts of the story. The plot sounded good, different, and it was. However, there was no real angst. The story, by design, starts out in the middle of the relationship. She does explain what led up to this point, however, the men never show their &#34;alpha-ness&#34; in any true sense and she just capitulates to them way to easily. None of them seem to have any friends or family as well. If she was so unhappy and lonely, why didn't she talk to them? Why is it only the three of them? The only other character mentioned is the men's personal assistant who seems to be on her side. But she doesn't confide in her either. Also, it is mentioned in the very beginning that one of the characters may not be happy with the arrangement and that line is quickly dropped, never to be mentioned again. I normally would highly recommend anything by this author but I don't feel I can with this one.

She couldn't take it anymore.  On what should be the happiest night of her life, her life was falling apart.  Catherine was going to have a baby, and now wasn't sure that she would have anyone to fill the father role.  She had planned a vacation for all of them, and now Rhys and Logan wouldn't even be there.  Everything was more important than she was.  She didn't even rank anymore.  So sure it was over, Catherine decided to go on the vacation to Jamaica alone to figure out what her next step was now that she was on her own.Rhys and Logan were panicked when they arrived home to find Catherine gone.  She had been gone for days, and they hadn't even known.  Figuring she went on vacation without them, they headed for Jamaica to get their woman back.  When they arrived, they couldn't believe how distant and withdrawn she was.  Rhys and Logan knew how abominably they had treated her not just recently, but for years.  That sad fact had become abundantly clear, and there was no one to blame except themselves.  Catherine had always been there loving them, and they were no longer sure she would stay with them.  Rhys and Logan had a lot of hurt to make up for, and would stop at nothing to convince Catherine she would always come first.MB has done it again!

After being married for five years, Catherine and her men are finally going to be parents.  She can only imagine how happy they will be, and the anniversary vacation the trio has planned to leave for the next day will be the icing on the cake. The longer Catherine waits, however, the more she realizes she has been stood up once again for business. She soul searches and comes up with the only conclusion she can think of, and so heads out on her anniversary vacation alone.Logan and Rhys love Catherine, their wife, more than they ever thought possible.  Striving to make their business successful so she would want for nothing has been tough, and they've had to make a lot of sacrifices, especially where their marriage is concerned.  When a client unexpectedly requires their presence in another town, Logan and Rhys don't hesitate. They leave immediately, completely forgetting their dinner date with their wife.  Upon their return, Logan and Rhys immediately sense something is wrong.  It seems their home is empty, and their wife has left without them.Catherine has to do a lot of soul searching.  She loves her men unconditionally, but she is so very tired of being taken advantage of.  She knows she is more important than just a phone call, and so makes the decision to stand strong where her husbands are concerned.

With every novel she releases, Stay with Me included, I find myself swept away in a story and plot line so gripping that I can't stop reading. Stay with Me could be about any wife who's taken advantage of and for granted.  When Catherine put her foot down concerning her feelings, I applauded her for being a strong woman.

At least they still had their upcoming two week vacation to Jamaica where they would have some much needed time uninterrupted. When Logan and Rhys postpone that to jet off on a last minute business trip, Catherine has to face the facts that her marriage is in serious trouble. Desperate for some time to think, she decides to go on that vacation without (telling) them. When Logan and Rhys return home to find her gone, they realize they're on the verge of losing the woman they love. Not willing to let her go without a fight, they chase after her and spend the next two weeks trying to gain her forgiveness as well as her trust.This story was an emotional roller coaster ride fro beginning to end. At first it was easy to side with Catherine. She's felt neglected for a long time, more so since Logan and Rhys began building their company from the ground up. Then we get glimpses into the minds of Logan and Rhys, and it becomes apparent that they love Cat beyond measure. They're not bad, just oblivious. When they finally catch up with her, they don't waste any time trying to convince her she's still their number one priority. However actions speak louder than words, and act they do.Catherine accepts responsibility that she's partly to blame for the breakdown of their marriage because she never told them how she really felt whenever they put the company before her. I liked that Logan and Rhys acknowledged that they'd messed up. They didn't try to dictate her around or make her feel guilty. However, after we find out about their background and that their quest to be financially successful was as much for her as it was for them, it made Cat seem clingy, needy and selfish (but it could have been her pregnancy hormones adding fuel to the fire). Despite being on vacation with her, they still had a company to run, and they left without leaving instructions behind, so it really bothered me that she would tense up and get angry or fearful whenever they'd take a work call or work email. Before things get better, there's a misunderstanding and more drama for them to overcome. In the end I think they redeemed themselves by making compromises that seemed so simple. If only they had come to that conclusion sooner. Hindsight is 20/20 and I think their relationship only got stronger because of all the heartache.Though the love scenes were steamy, I found myself skimming them. They weren't bad, but I was just more invested in the characters and their personal growth as they tried to navigate the pitfalls of work and marriage.

It seems the guys have been so single-minded in their pursuit of success that they have been neglecting poor Catherine.

The guys are hot and the reader realizes that they work hard for Catherine because the three began their lives together very humbly.

The plan is so secret that his wife Jolene doesn't know anything about it and isn't involved in its realization. However, she has to pick up the bits and pieces of her life, has to get used to the idea of being a widow and has to try to go on with her life.Six years after the death of her husband Jolene is a successful deputy marshal on an elite warrant team but her private life still suffers - she hasn't been involved with any man after her husband's death. Then, all of a sudden, Paul's worst fears seem to come true: an attempt on Jolene's life is made and Paul decides to ""secure"" his wife by taking her to the high security military base he is working. But what thinks Jolene about her husband's ""resurrection""?I would've liked to elaborate more on above summary but was really afraid to spoil too much since the plot was simple and straight forward, without creating any mentionable ups and downs. Except for few pages at the beginning of the novel, the whole book took place in the secret military base. Furthermore, the book didn't have any serious sub-characters, except for two of Jolene's colleagues and one of Paul's, who all made very rare and unmentionable appearances.  That wouldn't really matter if the interaction between the two main characters would've been outstanding and making the change in scenery and characters needless, which really wasn't the case, especially since Paul's  main target was completely one dimensional: he wanted only to get her into his bed and she couldn't resist.The more I read about Paul the less I liked him. By choosing his career he very consciously made the decision to lead a solitarily and withdrawn life, gaining in return for this sacrifice self-fulfillment through his academic achievements. Basically he made the very active decision to barter his private life for his professional life. So far so good, until he decides to marry Jolene against his better knowledge and for one reason only: he wants to get her into his bed.  As if this wasn't selfish enough, he decides to ""reappear"" after six years, without taking his wife's career and private life into consideration. This is no alpha male but just a stupid egoist!This isn't the first book I read from this author, however, I was deeply disappointed and very much surprised by the many 5* ratings it got!

Rather than wallow in self pity, Jo used his life insurance to attend a special training program for women interested in law enforcement.  She's made a name for herself and is now in one of the highly sought after positions on the elite warrant squad. The only area of her life where she hasn't moved on is her love life.  Since her husband's death, not once has Jo taken a lover even though she's had plenty of opportunities.As a member of the elite warrant squad Jo's used to facing down bad guys and plenty of injuries but the recent attacks against her are troubling.  Sure the protection team will do their best to protect her but even they are no match for the men who are after her.  Jo realizes that she's pissed off her share of perpetrators but even she's stumped as to who's after her and why.Paul Benate believed that he was doing the right thing when he allowed Jo to believe he'd died.  His position dealing with extremely classified projects makes him a target so he's had to live within the confines of a small base which is extremely difficult to penetrate.  When he learns of the attacks on Jo, he realizes that his sorry attempt at protecting her by letting her go has failed miserably.  The only option acceptable to him is having her brought to him.  The old Jo would have been ecstatic to learn that her husband still lives: the new Jo is beyond furious that Paul allowed her to be deceived for so many years.Jo's worked long hard hours to gain the respect of her team and make a life for herself - without Paul.  So him thinking that he has the right to have her kidnapped and brought to him is simply too much.  She may still love Paul but no way is she going to allow him to dictate her life.Mary Wine tells an amazing tale with STILL MINE!  I loved Jo's kick butt attitude and yet she still has this vulnerability that endears her to readers.  She's a feisty little woman and even Paul is stunned by the changes that have taken place with her over the past six years.  Paul is very much in love with Jo so even though she's furious with him, as a reader I couldn't help but want them to have their happily ever after.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","07 23, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

But Jolene wasnt anyways the tough Deputy Marshal. Six years ago she was a sweet and nieve 20 year old who thought she'd found the man of her dreams and married him. Less than a year later she was a widow and as hard as she's tried she hasnt been able to be with anyone else since. When an attempt is made on her life and she is shot the Marshals put her in protective custody but an elite Army team takes her from there to a secret Army base where everything she thought she knew about her husband and what happened to him is a lie.Turns out her husband isnt dead after all. Paul Benate is one of those freakinly smart men that works soley on Goverment top secret projects. He knew 6 years ago he had no business getting involved with Jolene but he couldnt resist the strange pull she had on him. He decided that she was to innocent and weak to be able to handle what she would have to being his wife and chose to let her believe he died. But now that his worst fear has come to life - a terrorist wanting to kidnap Jolene to get him to coroperate with them - he has no choice but to have her brought to him.The new and improved Jolene doesnt take her husbands deception well.

She was damn good at her job, and everyone knew it.  There was only one thing missing from her existence, and that was a personal life, and love.  Her one true love had been stripped away from her six long years ago, and to this day she still felt the acute pain of losing her husband Paul Benate.  Jo knew she should try to move on; give her heart a push to meet someone new, but she just couldn't do it.Paul wasn't dead as everyone assumed he was.  He had cut Jolene out of his life because he was working on classified projects, and he was terrified that someone would use her to get to him, so he had taken that possibility away.  He did keep tabs on his beautiful wife, and knew she hadn't moved on with someone else just the same as he hadn't.  When he could stand it no longer, he decided to have her brought to the current military complex he was working in.  Someone trying to get to him had shot her, and it was time he started protecting what was his.Jolene was abducted from her protection detail, and was being shipped to someone.  She had no idea what was going on, but decided that keeping a cool head would be her best line of defense.  She had to pay attention, so she could find an opportunity to escape.  Nothing could have shocked her more than coming face to face with the husband she had mourned for years.  She almost lost it, but reigned herself in, and took the only course of action she could at the moment.  Jo resorted to violence, and punched the husband she thought was lost.Paul is a man that was forced to live with a decision he wished with his soul he could change.  He knew he never should have given up his heart's desire in favor of what he wanted to accomplish professionally.  Jolene had existed without Paul for years, but never recovered from his loss.  As these two lost lovers try to rekindle the love, and loss of trust, outside enemies try to separate them forever.  This is a pretty good story, but in several spots it slows to a crawl, and is even boring at times.  Overall it is an interesting read, but not a keeper.","08 7, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Still Mine,1218067200

I wasn't always sure I liked Paul, but I didn't dislike him, so I found myself willing to give him a chance based on Jo's past regard for him. Jo, I loved! She had crawled out from her grief and became an amazingly strong female character, as a deputy marshal, able to hold her own amongst the military world that Paul drug her into. She was no damsel waiting for her knight to save her. I found the mystical attraction between Jo and Paul a bit over the top, but didn't think it detracted from the story too much.

Now she is a deputy marshal on an elite warrant team.  It's not been an easy road and Jo has succeeded, if you don't count the fact she can't move on from the love of her deceased husband.Paul Benate gave up Jo in a move he thought would prevent her from ever being harmed.  Paul has a brain that many would love to control and while he likes working for the military, he missed Jo every day these last six years.  When a report shows that Jo has been found and is a target, Paul demands to get back all he lost.When Jo and Paul meet again, the fireworks are many and pointed.  Jo is hurt and angry that she was lead to believe Paul was dead.  Paul wants to begin again, but first he has to convince Jo to both forgive him and to understand.  Love brought them together and drove them apart. Now when the danger to Jo seems to follow her, will love be enough to give Paul and Jo another chance?Still Mine has several of my favorite aspects in a story: hot sexy scenes, engaging main characters, and enough suspense that it makes you want to read quickly to find out the ending.  Jo has grown up and found a career even while loving the husband she believes is dead.  Paul made a decision he thought would save Jo from danger and was given a second chance.  From the moment they met face-to-face, I was drawn in and could not flip the pages fast enough.  Even before giving in to their passion, I could feel the strength of it.  I was quickly reminded that the emotions that give passion can produce equal fear and anger.  Watching Jo and Paul try and work out the past to hopefully lead to a new future for them showed me that a true and deep love never really dies.  When the danger comes from an unexpected angle, at least for me, I loved seeing the depth of the trust that had been restored between Paul and Jo.  Still Mine is equal parts hot romance and suspense, which I found not to be missed.  The cliffhanger ending leads me to hope that just maybe Jo and Paul will show up again soon in another book.Joreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","07 8, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Still Mine,1215475200

She's a woman on a mission and if that means trading in her tomboy look for `skank' clothes complete with thong underwear then so be it.  Over the past year she's watched her boss, Ridge, parade his various dates in front of her, and she's determined to finally be the woman he desires.Ridge Casey has had the hots for Morgan since the day he hired her to work at the architectural firm but since she never showed the slightest interest in him he wasn't about to put a strain on their working relationship. Seeing her sitting at her desk looking like sex personified is almost more than he can handle.  Fortunately Morgan puts him out of his misery and admits that the radical change in her appearance is all for him.Ridge and his business partner Carter are expecting an announcement regarding a bid they'd put in for the design of the Honor Center.  They've lost out on the last two bids they put in so everyone's hopeful that this time is the charm.  As soon as Ridge sees Morgan the bid and anything business oriented takes a backseat to staking his claim on her.  He considers her his woman and seeing her all gussied up brings out the caveman attitude in him - heaven help her if she's dressed like that for some other man.Once he learns that they've wasted a whole year pretending not to want each other, Ridge isn't willing to waste another moment. He certainly isn't going to allow any other man to see her dressed so provocatively.  Like the alpha male he is, he drags her away from the office and takes her to his place where they proceed to cement their relationship.  There's just a little problem that crops up - Malone and Casey have lost out on the bid and this time they know that someone in their business is selling inside information to the competition.  Is it possible the changes in Morgan and her seduction of Ridge are intended to cover up her involvement in sabotaging the company?Annmarie McKenna has quickly garnered many readers attention with her smoldering hot storylines and memorable characters.  Who hasn't been `in love' with the boss, a coworker, or even a teacher?  Morgan's shy boldness really struck a cord with me.  She's got an air of innocent hopefulness while still maintaining a confident air.  Ridge is wonderfully alpha while still being vulnerable.  I was charmed by his insecurity where Morgan's concerned.  I'd love to see a follow up story for Carter - possibly with a hook up with the office `witch' Amy Lee.  I admit it I really didn't like her but I could easily imagine Carter taking command of her - in a very good way.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","09 6, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

When he gets into the office, two things give his stomach a punch.  The first is Morgan and her new outfit and just how many of the other men at the firm have seen her in it, and the second is that they were somehow outbid again.Ridge has no choice but to deal with Morgan and her sexy outfit since his pants are beginning to not feel so comfortable.

1731,B00189ZCY6,"[16, 16]",3,"First of all, let me preface my review by letting you know up front that I don't consider A MATTER OF NECESSITY to be a romance.  It is a fictional FBI crime novel that just happens to feature two men in love.  The crime solving is the central plot, and the romance happens offstage.  Even the sex happens offstage.  In fact, at times it felt like everything in this book happened offstage.  Throughout the entire book I felt like I was reading a summary of a story, not the actual story itself.My problems with this book come from the fact that I never felt as though I was invited inside the story.  It was a very odd feeling.  The author's offstage style is such that I felt like I was reading the Cliffs Notes or watching bits and pieces of the story through a closed window, which was a real shame.  I absolutely adored the characters and I wish I had been allowed to experience their romance and their blossoming relationship first-hand rather than from behind closed doors.  Alex was surprisingly accepting of his love for his best friend and the social consequences that came with admitting he was gay.  Shawn was determined to show Alex how much he loved him and was willing to do anything for Alex's love.  How sweet is that?This is an entertaining book and very worthy of three stars, but I could have easily given it five stars if I'd been invited into the story and allowed to witness the tender romance between Alex and Shawn firsthand.  I recommend this book to fans of M/M cop drama, but romance fans may feel short-changed.","04 29, 2008",AL6WDE46RJ9I3,Amazon Customer,A MATTER OF NECESSITY by T. D. McKinney,1209427200

1733,B00189ZCY6,"[0, 0]",5,"This is a little discovery. I have this book since a bit, but for one reason or the other, I wait to a lot before reading it. And I immediately discovered my mistake cause since the first pages you can understand that this is a great romance, that the fans of the genre will love.Alex is a wasp FBI Special Agent who has fought all his life to avoid the innuendo from friends or colleague about him being gay. Actually he has never desired men, he loves women and finds very attractive all the women are. Only he is also a very uptight middle-classe man, who loves to grew roses, write poems and paint. And since he is also an handsome, but not bulky man, he is always mistaken for a gay man.So when he is undercover with Shawn, a big Australian Special Agent, very manly and handsome, he is totally unprepared when the big guy hits on him, and openly declares his attraction for him and the desire to be his lover... in the submissive position! True, they are undercover as gay lovers, but it's not necessary to play the role when they are alone in their house, but Shawn has no restrain and in the end he manages to involve Alex in an hot relationship. But when their mission ends, what will remain to them? They are teammate and the Agency maybe will be not so happy to have two agents involved in an open gay relationship.I like very much as T.D. McKinney manages to mix romance with reality. True, some scenes are really stretched to the limit of reality (Shawn's woo of Alex), but hey, this is a romance, and I like to read those things, they appeal to the ultimate romantic who is in me. But Alex is also a character who thinks and before throws himself in a relationship with Shawn, he works very hard trying to drive him back. Shawn instead is the dream of every woman, and man maybe: attentive and loving, the right dose of push and comprehensive attitude.It's really interesting to read the dichotomy between Shawn, with his bulky body, who is instead the more feely touching and exuberant in the couple, and Alex, who I envision like the classical prim and proper character, who seems cold and aloof, but when they threaten his lover, he reacts like a poisonous snake: silent but deadly.Only one remarks, very minimal indeed: T.D: McKinney is very good in writing the sex scenes, build them with a growing pathos, but she shut the doors in the apex... why does she not let peep in a little more?","05 18, 2008",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,A Matter Of Necessity by T.D.

1734,B00189ZCY6,"[5, 5]",5,"After working undercover as gay lovers for the better part of a year, returning back to their lives wasn't easy for FBI Special Agents Alex Ware and Shawn Matthews, especially when it turns out Shawn wants to continue being Alex's lover.  Shawn has been in love with Alex for years, but out of respect for their friendship and working environment, he never revealed his feelings.  Their undercover assignment was fate telling him this was meant to be, and Shawn took full advantage of the opportunity to finally show Alex how much he loved him.Alex never thought of himself as gay and had even less of a clue that Shawn might be gay. This was an assignment and you did whatever was needed to survive.  The fact that he actually liked kissing Shawn and his body came alive every time Shawn touched him only made their undercover identities more believable.  Once the sting was over and they made their case, things would go back to normal, so Alex believed.A Matter of Necessity was a romantic comedy with added suspense and drama.  Shawn was a lovesick puppy who drove Alex absolutely batty and I loved every minute of it.  Who wouldn't want this gorgeous g-man with a sexy Australian accent declaring to anyone who would listen how much he loves you?  Alex wanted to believe he didn't want Shawn, but he knew he would be lying.  He wanted Shawn just as much as Shawn wanted him, but Alex was afraid of the stigma of being gay.  I did feel for Alex and his struggle to come to terms with his attraction to another man, and Shawn's sweet, lovingly aggressive pursuit of him only added to his struggle.  Even though Shawn and Alex took a while to see eye to eye about their relationship, they never lost respect for one another as teammates or their fierce protectiveness of each other.  The reactions of their other teammates from the Bureau to their relationship was a mixed bag, with some reactions fitting perfectly to the comedic tone of the story.

1735,B00189ZCY6,"[1, 1]",3,"FBI Special Agent Alex Ware and his partner, Special Agent Shawn Matthews are in deep trouble. Deep undercover to try to nail a particularly offensive weapons trafficker who doesn't trust nor do business with sexually straight people, they're forced into an intimacy that Alex hadn't anticipated - but what really makes him worry is just how much he enjoys the six month deep cover operation. What shocks him is when his Aussie partner and friend, Matthews, comes clean on both his bi-sexuality AND his interest in Alex. An interest that supersedes any work-related cover op.And from that point on, Alex's life - as neurotic and repressed as it was - turns on its ear and becomes uncomfortable, uncertain, and wracked with yearning. In short, utterly unrecognizable.Shawn is adorable in his open devotion to Alex, and Alex is quirky and frustrating in turns as he struggles with his fear and sexual confusion.

Survivors band into safe communities and evolve their own rules.  When a shape-shifting wolf/man is cast out of his tribe, he struggles to survive alone.  Mason finds sanctuary in an ocean cove and slowly builds new relationships with another shape-shifter dolphin/woman and a boy suffering from radiation poisoning.  Mason learns more about his own skills and his role in saving his people from a future catastrophe.  His lover cannot leave the ocean but Mason must make the arduous journey back to his tribe and deliver an important message.The author's beautiful prose and imaginative storyline brings this tale to life.  She makes the reader understand how a wolf hunts and see an underwater world.  The story may be filled with ""magical beings"" but it's set in our own future.  It's not the typical werewolf story, nor is it entirely a bleak Mad Max type of world.  There is hope and redemption for people who can learn to adapt and accept love and kindness.I searched out a novel featuring wolves and I was delighted with this novel.  I recommend the book to anyone who loves animals and imagines what it would be like to become one.  This may be the first story of a series, but each book stands alone.

Go to a Catholic School, attending an all-girls college, and eventually graduating with her teacher's degree. However, Millie's father, Harold, doesn't want her to teach in Appalachia, where Millie has dreamt of teaching since childhood, instead he would rather her become a replacement for his secretary.It's not until they visit Moose Falls, Montana for a week trip, commending  Millie's recent graduation (yet it's disguised as a business venture for her father), when Millie truly allows to LET-IT-ALL-HANG-LOOSE!She meets Johnny Pickett, at the infamous boathouse from ""Letter to a Secret Lover,"" that his father owns and he is currently employed at. It was LOVE at first sight, for both of them. Nonetheless, Johnny is not what Harold would ever consider boyfriend material for Millie. The boy from the wrong side of the tracks, or in his case the boy who went to war, and returned a man.There is an instant attraction to Johnny and Millie, one that cannot be extinguished by anyone who gets in their way, especially Harold.

He sees forever and is anxious to grab onto that dream with every ounce of feeling he has.Johnny and Millie each know that their time together is short.  Millie's father is adamant that she become what he wants her to be and teaching is not part of the plan - neither is a man like Johnny.  When it is time for Millie to leave Montana, Johnny hopes he can convince her to stay because while he might not be the richest or the best choice for a husband, he has one thing that other men do not.

Before the night ended she ended up passing out and landing in the arms of Brock, a handsome Navy sailor.From that point they became friends.

He had withdrew from his family many years before because of a tragic accident. He thought his family blamed him. They didn't, they just wanted to be a part of his life. I really felt the emotions when he visited with his family.

What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again.

The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences.

They are about finding true happiness and dealing with family and issues that happen within families.  Each sibling gets their own story.Cal is the oldest brother; he hires his ex-wife Penny to re-vamp the family's flagship restaurant that used to be the pride of the family and now is on the edge of closure. Penny is a popular new and upcoming chef in the area but does not have enough money to start her own restaurant or start a family (even if it is on her own) she desires. She accepts Cal's offer in exchange, she has a few stipulations of her own. This story is about second chances, very sweet.Walker is the third brother and an ex-marine.  He leaves the military after his experience at war and comes home with ""baggage"" and needs to adjust to his new life.  His story is about adjusting, learning to trust others and allowing others to love him.Reid is the middle brother.  He was an ex-athlete who retired too early because of an injury.  He is used to his playboy ways and finds himself running the family owned sports bar.  He has problems with commitment as well as maintaining relationships that last longer than one night.  He hires Lori to take care of his grandmother.  Lori is the first woman who did not throw herself at him, so he is intrigued by her.I really enjoyed this bundle.

The bundle includes three novels, each dedicated to one of the three boys who are in search of goals for their own lives and in the process find love and in a way and acceptance of their grandmother- a tyrant.  Watching the transformation of this grandmother from a tyrant to a loving individual is a theme that runs through all four books. (TEMPTING is the story of the sister but is not included in the bundle.)DELICIOUS details the rekindling of love and marriage of Cal Buchanan and Penny Jackson - an exceptional chef.  They obviously had married at a young age, divorced, and are now finding their way back to each other.IRRESISTIBLE is my favorite and most enjoyable.  Walker Buchanan is a warrior who returns home seeking peace and finds the joy of love and the need to rescue  a young single mother and her daughter.SIZZLING is funny and entertaining as a playboy (Reid Buchanan) becomes interested in a woman who is very unlike his other conquests.  Their interactions are hilarious.I liked  these novels  because they provided an insightful picture of women who were  determined, independent, and loving.

For once it's Jacob who's having difficulties in his case and Victor (with a distressed Lisa) come to the rescue. In the previous books Jacob was the one in control, but in this book the single-mindedness with which he pursues both the resolution of his case and Victor borders on possession. Victor for once seems to be able to assert himself, even the way he embraces his jealousy was a surprise for me. He no longer accepts things at their face value, on the contrary, he questions his future and his past and he begins to handle his psychic ability.Jacob and Victor are changing and I really want to see what they become in the next book.","10 25, 2010",A1RXR105ND8OSH,manutwo,Another incredible episode in this awesome series!,1287964800
1850,B001BRD238,"[1, 1]",5,"Psycops is one of my favorite urban fantasies and Secrets is my favorite in the series thus far. Jordan Castillo Price has created a fun world, with interesting mysteries and with funny (yes, here is that word again) and sexy characters. Despite being urban fantasy, the characters and the setting are written in very a realistic manner and despite having a romance storyline throughout the books and the series, the romance does not overwhelm the storyline.The setting is Chicago and unlike another of my favorite urban fantasy authors that sets his books in Chicago, Jordan Castillo Price gets Chicago right. Throughout the Psycops series there are 4 key characters. Vic is the main character who is police officer. He is extremely insecure, socially awkward, completely jealous of his boyfriend's former lover yet still very endearing. Vic has an absent partner, Lisa - a very funny and loving person. Then we have Jacob, Vic's serious boyfriend and Jacob's partner Carolyn. Now comes the urban fantasy part of the series - Vic, Lisa and Carolyn each possess different psychic skills and as a result, are employed by police departments to assist in solving crimes. Jacob is not psychically talented but he is very much interested in people who are. Much of the series centers on Vic dealing with his ""talent"", which is seeing and communicating with ghosts, using his talent to solve a crime and the interplay of Vic's relationship with Jacob.The strength of the series to me is the incredibly complex characters Ms. Price writes, along with witty humor. When I am reading any one book in this series I am literally laughing out loud and marking excerpt after excerpt. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves urban fantasy, mysteries or just self-effacing humor. Below are some excerpts from Secrets I particularly liked:(Vic commenting on the new home that he and his boyfriend moved in to and of which he spent the recent few days attempting to organize - unsuccessfully): ""When I got home from work, the cannery looked like an actual dwelling instead of a warehouse that'd been organized by a nearsighted drunk.""""A flicker of actual interest registered in the receptionist's eyes.  `Third floor, Detective.'  And if she noticed that Lisa was dressed in a mishmash of men's sweats, she didn't so much as blink over it.""""the longer I sat there, the closer I was to trying another sip of that decaf coffee.  I stood up and wondered if I was supposed to walk around and pull Lisa's chair out for her, but she was on her feet and bussing her own tray before I even had my own chair pushed in.""""I looked at Jacob.  He was watching me.  Still smiling.  I did my best to telepathically scream, `What the hell?' I don't think he received it.""""How could he do this to us? To me.  To either of us.  We were all in on it, all four of us.  Lisa might survive women's prison if she joined a Mexican gang.  Carolyn wou8ld probably be a smear on the wall within the first week.  I could squeak by if I was still good at being invisible.  But Jacob would be a big trophy kill, shanked by some tough guy looking to prove himself, probably beaten and tortured first.  Jesus Christ.""""We walked more slowly carrying our steaming hot cups of coffee with their helpful warnings printed on the side.""Warning:  The book contains explicit m/m sexual scenes.","12 13, 2011",AFGQLBLB5ZNWI,"Regina ""Regina""",Funny Urban Fantasy Series,1323734400

His boyfriend, Jacob, is also a PsyCop, but he's the non-psychic half of a separate detective team in a different precinct. Vic rates as a level five medium (the scale goes to seven), and he's able to easily hear and see the spirits of the deceased who have not moved on yet. He also has a tendency to abuse his medications, but hey, if you kept seeing murders reenacted, you would too.""Secrets"" is a great read. We delve deeper into Vic like we never have before. His relationship with Jacob is being strained by both internal and external forces. He's being pressured to have a house-warming for his new place, but since he and Jacob aren't officially ""out"" on the force, he starts to more closely contemplate he and Jacob can or will be perceived by their peers. Also, he's come to discover that there's very little information about him on the Internet. None, actually. Someone, or some group, is going through great lengths to erase any mention of him anywhere.The characters are deep and complex. Victor's narration is addictive and compelling (and wittily sarcastic throughout). Romantic encounters are charged with eroticism and passion. This book is a little different from the rest in that it doesn't have as conclusive an ending. The ending is the obvious jumping-off point of the next book in the series, ""Camp Hell"". Being enjoyable in of itself, ""Secrets"" also serves to build great momentum for the conclusion found in ""Camp Hell"", making the two novels combined an incredibly enjoyable and passionate experience.

Cynthia Beller and Lee Maxwell understand that first hand as her father Claymore and Lee, accountants at the same firm working the blood money of the Kurev mob, tried to quit at different times.  Nine years ago Claymore and his family except for his daughter Cynthia were murdered; three years ago, Lee survived the hit, but his wife and daughter were killed.  Each of the survivors vowed separately vengeance.They meet for the first time as Cynthia having just finished a kill is about to leave when Lee enters the abode to assassinate the same thug.  They encounter one another twice more before agreeing they have the same list and strategic BHAG.  They agree to team up to destroy the Kurev family by dividing up the kills.

The vivid story line is action-packed especially with the scenes of the kills.  However, A.J.

Claymore Beller was an accountant for the Russian mafia, until the day he tried to turn them over to the IRS, resulting in the murder of his entire family, and of Claymore; or so they thought. Claymore's youngest daughter Cynthia survives and makes it her mission to get vengeance on the men who killed her family.Lee Maxwell's family was also killed by the Russian mafia for his own betrayal. He, like Cynthia, yearns to get vengeance for the deaths of his wife and daughter; and upon meeting, they decide to make the mafia pay for their crimes. Law enforcement and the media refer to them as the ""Grudge Ninja"".Owen Dunham has been following the ""Grudge Ninja"" case, but none of the evidence/profiles seem to get him any closer to apprehending the suspects. Until he figures out their motive, leaving him to decide whether the ""Grudge Ninja"" has the right to deal out payback, or if  it's his sworn duty to report them.Review:After reading A.J. Scudiere's Resonance, I was excited to read Vengeance, especially after reading the book blurb. The characters were very unique and well developed, and the plot was definitely solid, two of the many reasons that the book took off as soon as I started reading. I love a good thriller, but most times I find them predictable, so the fact that I was constantly on my toes trying to figure out what was going to happen earned this book huge Brownie points. I also appreciated the level of detail, particularly the grittiness, violence, and gore associated with the pairs' vendetta. I wouldn't be surprised to see this as a movie or as the plot in one of the many crime shows currently on television. This fast-paced thriller is definitely on my recommended list!Rating: On the Run (4.5/5)*** I received this book from Griffyn Ink (JKS Communications) in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","10 29, 2011",A34CKST8ITIORZ,"The Paperback Pursuer ""TPP""",Necessary vengeance...,1319846400
1901,B001BXN5HA,"[1, 1]",5,"Vengeance by A.J. Scudiere was one of two books I got from Scudiere's publisher for review.  I read Resonance first, and really enjoyed it.  I had saved Vengeance for last because it was written after Resonance and I didn't know if it was a follow-up with the same characters.  I quickly found out...  it's not.  It's *completely* different, and *really* good.  I had a harder time putting this one down than the first.  I'd have been perfectly happy had it gone even longer than its 400 pages.Lee Maxwell was an accountant with a nice happy family.  That is, until he discovered that he was working for a business run by the mafia.  His attempt to contact the authorities and leave his job only led to the gruesome death of his wife and daughter.  He went off the grid, buried his identity, and started working on getting revenge for the killings.  During one of his operations, he runs into another killer, ""Sin"", who is young, female, dressed in leather, and an expert in knives and slow, painful deaths.  It quickly becomes obvious that they have the same purpose in life...  revenge on the mafia and other assorted lowlifes who need to be stopped one way or another.  Owen Dunham, the FBI agent on the case, has to figure out who the ""Grudge Ninja"" is, and why ""he"" is killing all these people.  But should the truth be known, he'd rather allow the killings to continue, as it's a swift and deadly form of frontier justice.  Lee and Sin have to come to some sort of arrangement in order to stay out of each other's way and maximize their efforts.  Why should they both spend time researching the same target, only to find out the other one got there first for the kill?  But Sin has her own dark history that drives her revenge, and opening up to another person is not something she's able to do.  The revenge killings reach a crescendo as the FBI starts to get their first real evidence left behind at the scene.  The question becomes whether Lee and Sin will finish their list before the FBI (or the mafia) gets to them first...The story starts out from three very different perspectives, that of Sin, Lee, and Owen.  And it's not clear at first why Lee is gunning down scum, and why Sin is leaving dead bodies with multiple cuts and slices, complete with crime documentation, all wrapped up (literally) in a big red bow.  Dunham has his own issues, as he really wants to get out of the business and take time to enjoy his wife and daughter before she tires of his demanding job and leaves him.  But once Sin and Lee start to confront each other, the story and characters really start to jell.  Neither of them want to trust each other, but neither of them wants to eliminate the other, either.  This tentative truce gives way to the beginning of trust, all to seek vengeance against those who have destroyed their lives.  I was also quite satisfied with the ending, as I wasn't looking forward to how I *though* it was going to conclude.Very dark, plenty of action, and character interaction that was stellar...

1902,B001BXN5HA,"[1, 1]",4,"This is the second book by Ms. Scudiere that I've read, and what has struck me the most is how different her books are from one another. This not only applies to plot lines and characters, but also to pacing and style. She created a new, wholly different reading experience with this book compared to the last one I read.What drew me in immediately were the two main characters, Lee and Cyn (or Sin, as she is also called). They are brutal yet endearing killers out to get revenge for the wrongful death of family members. They are cold at first, hard for the reader to understand, but this soon changes. When they finally begin to work together, as a team, the way the author builds their relationship is worth the entire book. I was so amused by their interactions, taking this book from a plot-driven thriller to a deeper level.  The plot itself is fun, fast-paced (although it could have done with a bit of trimming of some fight scenes), and the reader feels in good hands as the author weaves her story together. There are many moments of tension, including sexual tension, which send the reader's heart beating just a bit faster. There is also a wealth of combat and self-defense research in these pages, obviously demonstrating the care the author took to be as accurate as possible with the violence.This is a fun story that I can recommend without issue.

I've way overspent my book buying budget since getting a kindle so had to focus on free down loads recently and frankly,  even for free most are too expensive - they are a waste of time!  So I was really pleased with this. There is erotic tension and angst between Jenesta and her husband, Roarke.  She's not quite clear why he married her,  but she loves him,  and he's gorgeous but so gentle in bed.  He has dreams and desires he dares not bring to her... until she stumbles into his secret chamber,  and all is revealed.Actually the entire piece is basically a set up to the chamber scene,  the chamber scene,  which is entirely sexual and not hard core bdsm,  more light spanking and bondage,  and then ramifications of the chamber scene.

He believes his appears makes people view him as a hideous beast.Lila will do anything to make sure her father is happy and healthy.

I think that part of the story would have been better received by readers if Lila did not give into to Hunter's demands until she was ready.  Yes Lila agreed to the deal, yes she knew she would had to eventually fulfill her obligations and yes she was attracted to Hunter but Lila should have been able to set the pace for their relationship and not Hunter.  I feel that the author should have given that power to Lila and not Hunter and that is why other reviewers had issues with.Because of the Lila's first night I had a hard time reading the sex scenes.

Bursting into Hunter Jamison's office to demand he cease and desist, Lila was taken aback by what he demanded in exchange for her father's shop.Disfigured in a car accident Hunter Jamison felt he lost everything that mattered when he lost his looks.  He knew no woman would want to be with him if he wasn't rich and powerful, and even then his money wasn't enough for some when faced with having to look at his scarred features on a daily basis.  When Lila stormed into his office with her fiery temper and beauty to match he wanted her like he's never wanted any other woman before, and knew the only way she would want him was to proposition her using her father as leverage.Mistress to the Beast is a cute twist on the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale.  I really liked Lila, she's a straightforward tell it like it is type of woman.  And even though she succumbed to Hunter's wishes in order to help her father she never held her tongue when it came to telling Hunter what she thought of him.  My feelings for Hunter waffled a bit.

And in this arrangement he flat out told her he wanted to have sex with her in exchange she got what she wanted. He gave her WEEKS to back out and thought she would, she didn't. Also, even up until the point where he was touching her he told she could back out. There was no holding down and raping. She was suprised(and ashamed) herself she WANTED to have sex with him. And even after the first time he continued to tell her she could back out of the deal. Was he a little crude(he was crude when he made the offer,she shouldn't have been shocked) yes, stern, yes.

And I know that Lila pretty much prostituted herself out to Hunter to save her father's business but, surprisingly, I really enjoyed this book. It was just a well written story.  Parts that would normally make me roll my eyes somehow didn't.  Even though Hunter is demanding and seemingly merciless to Lila in the beginning, the author does a good job of getting us inside his head so we know he's not just being a jerk for being a jerk's sake.  In a way he was right,  it was a business arrangement and they both knew why she was there.  Lila is no pushover and I found her resolve refreshing without being overbearing.  The sex scenes are HOTTTT, yes, even when Lila can't stand him or so she thinks.  I loved the gradual progression of their friendship and the realization of their feelings.  Loved the scenes with Lila and the dogs, which allowed Hunter to first get a glimpse into his feelings for Lila and I enjoyed their dinner conversations.  When things got comfortable between them, it gave me the warm fuzzies.  I pretty much loved everything about the book. I knocked one star off because I thought that the way that Hunter chose to end their contract was unnecessarily lame and only served to throw in a twist. There was no need for that and it was the only thing that spoiled the book for me.  Of course, they got back together so all's well that ends well.This is definitely a book that I will read  many times over.

I have read many techno-thrillers and it is easy to get burned out with them. Unfortunately, in most top-selling techno-novels, the technical stuff can get a bit boring and easily clog up the plot.Also, as a practicing and ""born again"" Christian, I was a little unsure how in the world an author could meld the Christian aspect with a technical thriller. Would it be ""hokey"" or would it beat the reader to death? I should not have worried!I must admit, this is a phenomenal story, outstanding characters, and many may find a lot in their own lives mirrored here! The author sure ""knows"" people and their inner thoughts! The plot is superbly scary with North Korea as the antagonist. Extremely plausible story line. It grips you from the very beginning and goes to the last page. One more thing, it is also a ""love"" story!This, being the author's only fiction book, has me amazed. Clancy, Weber, and other techno-writers better watch out if this guy ever decides to go full-time fiction writing!Lastly, as a Christian, I was absolutely absorbed in the Biblical aspects and quotes. If you are not a practicing Christian, read the book anyway. You won't be put off, and may learn a thing or two!If you are a practicing Christian, you will surely shed a few heart-felt tears! I did!

Warwick is masked muscle for a corrupt businessman as he saves up for the revenge of the death of his parents. When they meet up, sparks fly and worlds tremble.Icy Heat isn't going to win any ""best written book ever"" awards, but I really liked it. And I don't usually like or read futuristic sci/fi novels. Definitely character driven, this story is way more about the people, Aidan and Warwick, than it is about world building or plot development - and that's okay. I wasn't expecting it to be heavy in those areas. But what it IS is surprisingly GOOD with the characters.Aidan is a control freak and has a history of not caring at all for physical contact. She's got a deep love and sense of obligation for her brother Zach, who is addicted to gambling and racking up big debt. I like that she's strong and smart without being a total bitch, and I was actually impressed with a particular scene in which she has to deal with the reality of killing a man. It wasn't focused on for long, but that there was any thought at all given to the complex emotions such an action stirs up, however accidental the killing, was a surprisingly fresh change on the kick-ass and almost conscienceless killer heroines of most urban fantasy/sci fi stuff I read.Warwick is scarred and damaged from those scars, keeping his face and body hidden as his cold heart and colder life is given over to exacting revenge on the man responsible for his parents death and the scars he keeps hidden. When he meets Aidan and starts to spend time with her, his vulnerability shines through and makes him eminently likable. He really is what made me like the story as much as I did. The childlike confusion and wild hope when Aidan accepts him, scars and all, was so endearing.There were huge gaps in the plot and I would've loved more definition in the world building, more glimpses of Aidan's and War's past, but it's a short book, more novella length, and for what's there, I was satisfied that the core of the story was well represented.

An answer that is mutually beneficial to him and his new bride, and that will hopefully finally quell the gay rumors swirling around Hollywood's latest superstar. Kiona would never have guessed she would have to take such drastic measures as to marry a stranger but if it's between that and losing the home and the man she loves she's willing to do what ever it takes. Nothing prepared Kiona or Mitch for the instantaneous attraction that resulted in their initial meeting or the interesting secret the love of her life Kol has been keeping from her. A secret that just might help the union between three people become a triad made in heaven. That's if they can protect each other from Kiona's manipulative father before he wrecks all of their lives for good.In a story that shows what people are willing to do during desperate situations, Kabana Heat entices readers with the beauty and allure of the Hawaiian Islands and its exotic inhabitants. From the first page the stage is set when Hollywood actor meets island vixen and even as she tries to fight the heat they produce just from being near each other, Mitch is not so willing to loose a chance at experiencing how her passionate nature would translate in the bedroom. In steps the jealous and also bi-sexual lover of the heroine and this book takes off on one emotional situation after another. Feelings are dangerous enough without adding in jealousy, hurt and meddling parents who won't let go. Titania Ladley did an interesting job of setting of these three and the only thing I would have liked to see differently maybe a slower build-up between the two men. It was a little hard to swallow that two men who were so far in the closet would jump out within one meeting. Outside of that little hiccup this is really a flaming hot m&eacute;nage that sizzles the fingers for sure!IndyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","07 22, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Kabana Heat,1248220800

He knows that that a future for them is impossible, she&#8217;s human, he&#8217;s a vampire, but she&#8217;s someone special.

Those are only a few words I can use to describe Trigg, a vampire who has sworn to protect civilization from the rogues of his kind.After escaping years of abuse from Jack, the last thing Robyn was looking for was another man trying to control her, yet that is exactly what she got. Who wouldn't want to take care of a starving, visibly abused female like Robyn? Trigg only wanted to make her evening a little easier by purchasing her a real meal, but that one meal turned into a lifetime.Your heart will immediately go out to Robyn in this story. I was a little concerned that the love story was about an eighteen year-old, because that seemed a little too young in my mind but it worked well since Robyn was forced to grow up fast due to the abuse she lived with. I also enjoyed the way her previous circumstances made her adapt to Trigg and the other Watchers' way of life easily.Trigg, like many men in these types of novels, is your typical Alpha male. He would have to be in order to be a Watcher for his kind. Only around Robyn can he allow himself to show his softer side. So between Robyn's need for protection, and his need to loosen up, they come together wonderfully.The plot line was phenomenal. The way everything tied in together was perfect. The story was constantly moving forward and kept me turning page after page. It's one of those books where you say to yourself this is the last chapter I'll read, but yet you keep going until you realize you've read the entire book. It also sets you up perfectly for the next book in the series which I cannot wait to read.This was a great love story between two well-deserving characters that you definitely do not want to miss.

The two women are transported into a living hell of extreme physical and emotion abuse.Ms. McEntire's portrayal of these particular scenes is gut wrenching.

It was absolutely wonderful and the characters will steal your heart :)Brace yourself when you start to read this book. The beginning will have you an emotional wreck.  It sure did me. I was so angry and sad all at the same time. I felt absolutely horrible for Robyn and all that she went through. She endured a lot of abuse and it really got to me.Robyn was a very strong young lady. She went through things that most people wouldn't survive yet she kept going and doing the best that she could.  When she meets Trigg, I immediately adored him. He is so very charming and mysterious. But then you learn that he's so much more. He is very caring and has a really big heart especially when it comes to Robyn. I loved how as soon as he laid eyes on her he was protective of her and wanted to do nothing but help her and show her that not everyone was going to hurt her. Everything about him will make you love him.""Before you came into my life. I wanted nothing and no one. I lived day in and day out caring only about my mission to seek out and destroy Rogues. You have shown me something I have never felt before-love. I almost lost you and I couldn't bare it. Will you have me as your mate?""Then she meets Trigg's friends, Vane and Rayne. They both welcome her just as Trigg did and accept her in their lives. They all help her to grow and show her the good that is in the world. They all help her to open up her mind and she finally feels safe and at home with them.I really enjoyed seeing their love for one another grow and that no matter what they learned about each other they still wanted to be with one another. Even when she discovers who Trigg really is, she isn't afraid of him and trusts him.  I loved and mean loved getting to know about the watchers and vampires in this book. The guys are all three amazing and I instinctively loved all of them.  I loved all of the characters in this book with the exception of those who hurt Robyn and her mother.I was so glad when Robyn met Rosa, Darla, Phillip, & Abigail. They all pretty much became like family to her, she finally had friends and that made me so very happy. Rosa was great to Robyn from the start and helped her out which made me love her that much more.Now brace yourself for the end of the book as well. I couldn't help it, I cried because of what happened. Robyn truly had one of the biggest hearts and very courageous which she shows near the end when she saves Darla & Abigail. I was so happy that Robyn gets to see her mother again. Even though she's faced with a decision that could forever change her life. I don't want to give too much away, but I was so rooting for a happy ending at this point and hoping that Trigg and Robyn would get the ending they so much deserved. Thankfully the more I read the happier I got. I was beyond ecstatic for the two of them.I can't wait to get to read the next book in this series so I can see where things go for Vane and Rosa because I loved both of them in this one.","10 5, 2013",A1FOA6ZJTM31O3,VernaDene,Completely Adore Trigg!!,1380931200

This novella is just that -- a short story.  It comes in  at 78 pages according to Amazon and I want to mention that it is even shorter than that since the last 10 percent maybe of the book is previews for other stories.This is a sexy and short M/F/M menage read.  The main couple is John Garrett and Shelby Harper with the third person involved is Carson Scott. After pining for each other for a year, Shelby finally invites John and Carson up to her place after closing time.  She had the cafe open during a heat wave for the service men and she over hears Carson and John talking about how vanilla Shelby probably is.  Shelby is convinced to show them how un-vanilla she is by acting out her fantasy of two men at one time.I really enjoyed this short story and the writer made it believable.  While Carson was more of a third wheel in the story, he was a pivotal player in getting these two together.  Even though it does feature instant love after one night together with a small glitch of insecurities, I could actually see these two people together for the long haul.While it was in no means a book that will be above others, I will say that this short story was a great start to being introduced to this author for the first time.  If this had been a full length novel, I am sure it would have rated higher in my opinion. New readers of this author will get a quick thrill with John and Shelby and will be wanting to follow it up with the next novella in the series.","03 10, 2013",A1U09Q4OP6XIK6,A.

Garrett is crazy for Shelby but thinks she is too proper to consider him as a partner...Shelby overhears Garrett's friend describe her as vanilla and immediately challenges the two of them to a menage...I thought the book omitted a lot of opportunity to develop the characters but you only have so much time in roughly 1500 lines. Jumping from flirting to a menage was a bit of a stretch and I have to suspend reality to think for one moment that it wouldn't break up a good friendship - but this is fiction so go with it.If you are looking for exciting SEAL action like Suzanne Brockmann - forget it. This is not that kind of book. If you're reading for pure entertainment and you don't mind a lot of sex, this is for you. The SEALs are all good friends and buddies but you don't see much military action at all. If you read more of the books you will hear more about the characters from previous books.The storyline is good, the story is good but don't make it more than what it is.

Don't expect it to be a full romance novel, it is not, you will probably finish it in a single sitting.  Garrett is a Navy Seal and has been going into Shelby's bakery for about a year.  He has the hots for her and she has the hots for him, but somehow they both missed each other's signal until one day she overheard pieces of a conversation between Garrett and his best friend Carson.  She thought the reason why he wouldn't go out with her was because she was a good girl and a little too tame.  After that, she set out to prove him wrong by propositioning him and his best friend to have a fling with her.Garrett was shocked, but he agreed because he wanted to be with her any way possible.  There is a m/f/m scene, but it was just rated R and not graphic.  This is a beginning of what looks to be a fun and sexy little series by Elle Kennedy.Story was short and sweet, full of sexiness, humor and perfect to read if you don't want to start reading a book that will take too long.

Then one night she overhears that the reason he has never pursued her is that ""she's vanilla.""  Whoever thinks she is vanilla has never been in her daydreams.  So she sets out to show John just how wrong he is.John has had spicy daydreams about the cute little baker for a long time now, but she is so wholesome, he won't ever act on them.  Then one wild and crazy night, during a heat-wave, she propositions him and his best friend.  How could he say no?  But will the night be a one-time-only? Or will he and Shelby finally see their true feelings for each other?Oh, baby! Two sexy Navy SEALS and one woman, what more could you ask from an erotic story? Well, if you are me, you want a great plot and a spunky woman to bring them all together.  Heat of the Moment has both and definitely does the trick. I thoroughly enjoyed how Shelby finally decides to make a move, and figures out (by overhearing a conversation) the way to make sure that she gets what she wants.  And boy, does she get it.

Garrett and Carson sure know how to show a girl a good time and I wouldn't have minded stepping into Shelby's shoes for the night! Although we don't get to know a great deal about the characters there was enough of a back story for me to believe that Shelby and Garrett would make a good couple.

It's hard to explain what I hated about this book without specific references to what DIDN'T happen. No plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Disappointing book 2 of the Halle Pumas paranormal romance series that starts withThe Wallflower: A Hunting Love story, Halle Puma Series Book 1.. You HAVE to read book 1 first as this one starts during the climax of that book. While I am a fan of Ms. Bell's work, I have to tell you I am REALLY disappointed with this book. Book 1 was overly simplistic, but I could forgive that because it was book 1- this book was a step backwards entirely. I'm not even sure why this story got to be its own book. It could have been just an additional chapter or two in book 1.CHARACTERS: It is possible for characters to be UN-DEVELOPED? Simon and Becky are both great characters- but they were developed more in Book 1 than in this book ABOUT THEM. In fact, many of their mannerisms from book 1 disappeared and they became just cardboard cut-outs of what any couple in any shifter romance story could be. The tension between them evaporated- they were dancing around each other before, afraid and uncertain. Simon was artistic and a ladies' man and Becky was the shy, well-grounded partner in her store, but none of those characteristics were apparent in this story. They actually LOST their personality.PLOT: There was even LESS plot here than the product description implies. This was basically a continuation of book 1. There was no additional storyline. No additional conflict. No new bad guys. No new obstacles. It looked like Becky might have a long road to recovery after the attack- she needed to heal and to come to terms with what happened and finding out about the pumas... and that was all resolved in a couple paragraphs. Becky wasn't mad. She wasn't scared. She wasn't even badly injured. She didn't resist Simon. She didn't play hard to get. Simon didn't have to woo her or apologize. Simon supposedly had been a ladies' man- but even THAT didn't become an issue. No confrontation with Belinda or other exes. No discussion around why they never dated or expressed interest in each other sooner... NOTHING!!! More happened between these two in book 1 than here. It takes exactly one minute for Becky to just accept the existence of werecats, the fact that she's Simon's mate, and the fact that she has been turned into one.Like Max with Emma, Simon changed Becky into a puma without warning and without asking permission. She didn't complain- not ONE word of protest. She wasn't concerned about what it might mean for her life. She wasn't even surprised. Seriously, that's just absurd. If for no other reason than it could have offered something more substantial for the story!!!There was a very bizarre plot element of having Becky able to tell when the phone was going to ring before it did. What on earth was that about? It was cute, but didn't come to anything.BOTTOM LINE: This book was infuriatingly dull. I would tell you not to bother reading it, except I expect you probably need to if you want to bother with the rest of the series. I'm not really sure I do at this point. Ms. Bell's The Grey Court series is MUCH better than this one- at least it has a plot.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2.

It was supposed to be a fun filled evening with friends at a masquerade party but instead she's fighting for her life and all of a sudden her life is irreversibly changed.  She certainly never suspected that her friends and Simon, the man she loves, have the ability to shift into Pumas.  Sure she wants Simon but eating cat chow and using a litter box holds absolutely no appeal so what's a girl to do?Simon already suspected that Becky is his mate before the attack but he hadn't claimed her or even let on that he had any intentions toward her.  His mate's life being threatened brings out all his protective instincts and he certainly isn't about to listen to Becky's arguments against their mating.  It's a done deal as far as he's concerned.  Before he can satisfy his inner animal and mate Becky though he has to take care of her injuries and even then she argues with him.  It's when she tells him `bite me' that he sees the perfect opportunity to get exactly what he wants - to claim her.  There's no denying that they're mated after he's marked her as his!Livia's attack on Becky was completely unprovoked and makes absolutely no sense to her - all she knows is that Livia has suddenly sprouted claws and fangs and is intent on killing her.  It isn't until Becky's best friend Emma arrives that the pieces begin to fit together.  Livia's envious of Emma's status within the pride and believes that if she can acquire the Curana's ring then she'll be queen instead of Emma.  That's not how things work though and `Senora Psychopath' is in for a rude awakening because Max, Emma and Simon aren't about to let her get away with what she's done.  Livia's sentenced to life as an outcast and Simon carries Becky off as his new mate.  If Simon thinks he's simply going to claim her and they'll live happily ever after then he'd better think again.  Sure Becky loves him but she's stubbornly refusing to say the words, her change is taking longer than it should, and she's suddenly ailing and the doctor's diagnosis isn't fully explaining the odd symptoms.Dana Marie Bell writes this story with such humor and drama that I was quickly caught up in the romance between Becky and Simon and was unable to put this book down.  SWEET DREAMS is the second book in the HALLE PUMA series and flows beautifully from the first book WALLFLOWER.  Becky's feisty comments and loving nature really kept me chuckling and Simon seems to get a real kick out of her snappy comebacks.  I loved getting to know all of the characters in this story and they each quickly began to feel like treasured friends that I'll be happy to revisit many times in the future.I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for more Dana Marie Bell's books in the future.  This story was fun, whimsical and wholly satisfying.  I'd definitely recommend picking up the other books in the HALLE PUMA series as well.  WALLFLOWER, SWEET DREAMS and CAT OF A DIFFERENT COLOR are all wonderful stories that truly capture the imagination.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 23, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

Becky isn't about to let Livia get a piece of her without giving something back, but those sure are some strange sounds coming out of that woman. Finding out that your best friend, your best friend's new boyfriend, and the man you have been lusting after are other than human is a bit of a shocker, but Becky is no weak-willed lady Plus, she has to decide the fate of the bitch that had attacked her.When Simon finally gets Becky secured in his home, the Puma in him purrs. If he had any doubts at all about her being his mate, they had been erased at the scent of her blood and the sight of Livia crouched over her in the Friedelinde's garden. It was a good thing Becky had not even jokingly mentioned killing Livia as Livia's punishment for attacking her, because Simon would not have hesitated killing Livia for spilling his mate's blood. In fact, it had only been the fear in Becky's face, fear of him, that had stopped him from doing that anyway. He would have to work on that fear.We got a taste of the Simon/Becky romance in ""The Wallflower"", the story that introduced the Halle Pumas, but now they are back with a vengeance to resume their story in Sweet Dreams. Becky is as sassy as ever and Simon is sweet, strong, and sexy with a healthy dosing of protectiveness and possessiveness from both the man and the Puma. Seriously, what woman wouldn't love the guy? Though I have to say I'm rather glad Becky doesn't just fall all over him because this story is a great deal funnier for it.

That's why she's heading back to her hometown in rural Idaho to confront her memories and feelings once and for all.Nice guy Kyle Watson and dark and brooding Alan Caine have known Cassie since she was just a little girl.  They'd been inseparable and as they grew up their feelings inevitably changed to a deep-seated desire which none of them addressed.Eventually Kyle and Alan's feelings result in a sexual frustration that needs to be assuaged so they turn to each other.  Unfortunately Cassie witnesses their encounter and jumps to the conclusion that they've chosen each other over her.  It's been three years since she last saw either of the men and she learns they now live and run a ranch together.  Kyle and Alan aren't stupid, they realize that Cassie would never choose one of them over the other so they'd agreed to share her - that had been before she'd run away.  Now that she's back it's up to them to convince Cassie that they love her and a relationship between the three of them could work.Sierra Dafoe has definitely won over many readers with her warmhearted, tender storylines.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan's unique relationship fascinated me because the men waited so long for Cassie to return to them.  Their love for her is obvious in everything they do.

If you haven't read his blog, be warned: Do not have a beverage near your computer when you read the entry about the lawnmower.That said, I read Dead Man's Rain first and had so many questions that I emailed Frank. What's a Jerk? Which war was this, where is this set, etc. Silly me, still forgetting that this is a fantasy. I missed out on a lot of the background by not reading The Mister Trophy first, so if you're reading this and haven't read any of the other Markhat series yet, definitely start with this one.

These are big, scary, long-fanged, gargly-voiced trolls with translation spells, definitely not adorable.Markhat is a 'finder', Tuttle-speak for Private Eye. He's also a smart aleck and as entertaining as protaganists get. The book is short, but that's okay, there are three more to read, soon to be four.The Markhat world also features vampires, aka the half-dead, ogres, Mamma Hog, a reader who mothers - and puts hexes on - the sometimes reckless Markhat.All of this sounded silly to me when I read the description, but Frank manages to take all this insanity and turn it into a wildly entertaining read.Start with this one and keep on going...they just keep getting better!

Sardonic, embittered, suspicious, but at heart a gentleman and an honorable ex-soldier, he expects the worst from everyone and brings out the best in many.Tuttle's world is very reminiscent of Terry Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork. Very reminiscent - to the point where it bothered me quite a bit. Not only is there the same mix of fantasy and urban reality, you have Trolls playing a very large part in the story - and they're identical to Pratchett's trolls. Even the opening reminds one of the start of 'Guards, Guards'. The character names are very similar, as are the details of shops and the city and the river. Not identical, mind you, just a bit too close an imitation at times. As 'Dead Man's Rain, progresses, however, it finds its own unique voice and setting, and I stopped thinking this was Pratchett noir.'Dead Man's Rain' is a horror story and a narrative about venal instincts, greed and guilt. The set up is a little Maltese Falconish, and Markhat's weary cynicism is pure Spade as he deals with the snobby Widow Merlat and a incredible tales of ghosts and hauntings. But then, just as Tuttle sets you up thinking the plot will be resolved one way, he takes you down another. We learn more about Merlat's family, and her, and her servants, and Markhat reveals the qualities that kept him alive through a bitter and destructive war, in order to save the good and punish the wicked. This is not a romance - there's no pairing in this at all - and that's how it should be for our tarnished hero.Tuttle's writing is delightful, and even if he's borrowed some settings a little too heavily, Markhat's his own memorable creation, as are the plots and the dialogue. He's funny, in a very Bogartian sort of way, but like Pratchett, there's a deeper thread to his narrative than simple humour, with many a wry observation on human and non-human behaviour, populating his stories with vivid characters who continually surprise the reader.Really, there's nothing not to like here, if you like this genre, and aren't put off by the lack of romance. Finder Markhat is someone I want to read more about, and I hope Mr Tuttle revisits him.","06 16, 2009",A31LB0DBMZJT72,"Ann Somerville ""Love, romance, and the occasi...","Unusual, gripping, a damn good read",1245110400

She was working out with Lacey at the gym when she had a panic attack, and was mortified that Lacey's brother Blade Vaughn was there to witness it.  A group of guys tried to hit on her, and she freaked out.  He stepped in because he thought they were harming her, but was confused when he discovered otherwise.  Lacey stepped in and helped her get away without any more additional trauma.Blade had wanted Candy for longer than he cared to remember.  He didn't know her well, but had wanted to remedy that situation.  He thought he might have an opportunity at the gym, but after her episode, it was impossible.  When he asked Lacey what had caused her severe reaction, she was completely tight lipped, and told him to ask her himself.  Blade couldn't let it go, and when he found himself at her home for the first time, he wasn't sorry he was there, but only sorry for the circumstance.  He could see instantly that she was beyond uncomfortable with his spontaneous visit.  After some coaxing, he finally got her to confide in him.  Blade had never been so horrified or angry after hearing her story.  He couldn't believe someone would take advantage of someone as beautiful as Candy.  It took some persuading, but he convinced her to give him, and them a chance.Candy has lots of baggage, and emotional trauma to overcome, but what a great guy she has in Blade to help her over any hurdles.  He is loving, and most important, patient.  Their story is sweet.

What intrigued me the most was that the heroine, Andrea, was almost bad enough to be the bad guy with her tormented past. I had never read a book that made me wonder if the good guy was going to go to the ""dark side"" but this one did. It left me guessing on the reasoning behind why Andrea was there.. to kill Clive or to join him.

It does contain graphic material on incest and child abuse, if you can't handle those subjects do not read this book as they are an intricate part of the story line.The story line was a slow dreamy pace that built up into a huge climatic ending that left you kind of sad but sated with how it ended.

Rather this is an introspective poetic examination of an ex-alcoholic, ex-police woman, Andrea.  How easy would it be to like someone like her, with her lack of judgement, and self-mutilation habits?  Can someone this bizarre be appealing? Yet, by the end of the story... you will be on her side.  Andrea is now on a mission, selected by a secret police force, to rid the world of a serial killer, Clive, who had picked her up at a bar and had tried to kill her, only to later escape from maximum security prison.  She goes to Louisiana, posing as the killer's fiancee, and meets his modern day Adams family.  There, she waits, expecting him to turn up, so she can kill him.  We can even grow to understand these folks.  Good, evil and shades in between are mixed with the flavors of the South as Andrea lives with them and discovers their secrets.  Abrupt moments of extreme violence are balanced by Andrea's increasing attachment to the young girl in the family, also a victim of child abuse like herself.  I read this in a measured way, intrigued by the psychological drama and the sense of place.

Twilight has more than it's share of perversion, rage and hate.  There are many ""babies of rabies"" in this tale.  Only a cleansing fire can make it right.Text contains contradictory imaging (""Five years of bone dry summers and rainy seasons without rain has turned Kisatchie into kindling waiting for the match.""  ""Andrea steps to the edge of the platform and looks down to see her reflection in an oily pool of water."")  This is only one example of inattention to detail.  There is absolutely genius imaging (""...the basketball hits the asphalt, the sound is like a fist striking flesh"" creating a visceral image and completely clueless imaging such as ""An impossible sun...wasted sky..."".  What exactly does that mean?The protagonists are both victims and are trying to find ways to make the suffering go away--opposite sides of the same coin.  Even though the disorganization of the story--multiple characters continually switch with one another between the present and the past--reflects the mental state of both Clive and Andrea, it makes the story very hard to follow.  When Andrea finds transportation to Twilight the sounds she hears, the body she finds, and the location of the car are completely lost as the story progresses.The story is jerky making it hard to read, but the phrasing is vivid drawing you in.

The first one is not part of this series, therefore, this is my first exposure to the main character, Hannibal Jones. He is what appears to be a really ""neat"" guy. He is a private investigator who knows how to get to the bottom of any problem that comes his way. Jones is extremely capable and efficient as he sniffs out a crime in order to bring about some kind of justice in his own unique way. In this fictional novel, Jones remains unintimidated by some heavy duty, mob connected individuals...and refuses to cower in the presence of some very descriptive crime scenes. He also appears to be a man with a conscience which further endears him to me. His main squeeze is successful lawyer, Cindy Santiago, whose presence spices up the plot with their little romance.Author Austin Camacho manages to adeptly spin a suspenseful yarn as he entices his reading audience to be drawn right into the storyline. He certainly had my attention right from the get go. I not only enjoyed the main character, Hannibal Jones, but also his supporting cast of individuals who add to the thrill of this mystery.

The storyline of Belora's (Maiden Flight) mother, Adora finding love after she has been a widow for 10 years is wonderful particularly when the man she meets is also a widower who lost his family. The meddling of the dragons is cute and very astute.The only fault I found was the story of her lost twin daughters being told several times, yes, it did move the story forward but it could have been better condensed.The introduction of new characters was handled well and the enemy king and his plans was well thought out and a great plot twist.

2159,B001DOHZ5A,"[2, 2]",5,"Second in the Dragon Knights series, which is a different take on dragonriders; it resembles Anne McCaffrey's Pern books but is definitely for adult readers. The story starts with Lord Darian of Skithdron bedding a woman in a palace in order to gain access to secrets. He then decides that Lord Venerai and his ruler King Lucan are both deranged and evil.Two neighouring kingdoms, Draconia and Skithdron, are at odds and while the former boasts dragons as native beings, the latter has venomous serpentine beasts called skiths. These usually solitary creatures are being controlled for use in warfare by King Lucan. Adora, a healer woman, has just been seriously wounded by skiths and saved by a dragon, and now she is resting in the BORDER LAIR while her injuries heal. An older dragon knight called Jared, bonded to a female dragon called Kelzy, is caring for her and gradually falling for the courageous woman. Prince Nico of Draconia arrives and discerns that Adora is likely to be of lost royal blood, as she can 'hear' dragon speech and magically heal others.Belora, daughter of Adora, is also working as a healer, and mated to two dragon knights - women being scarce, the men willingly share a partner. Warfare is now waged openly between the kingdoms, the dragons flaming the skiths, which spit back acidic venom, while diamond-tipped crossbow bolts capable of piercing dragon scales are suddenly brought into use by the Skithdrons. Darius, fearing that the evil magic he has witnessed is taking over King Lucan, decides to defect in order to warn Draconia, thereby putting himself into grave peril. Meanwhile Adora is the subject of a well-meaning conspiracy by the dragon Kelzy, who decides that the woman requires two dragon knight mates.This is part of a complex series but can be read as a standalone, with sympathetic characters and well-imagined medieval warfare. Be warned, it features threesomes in a loving relationship between three life partners. Bianca D'Arc has written several books in this and her other fantasy series.

2170,B001DOHZ5A,"[2, 2]",4,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBORDER LAIR is the second book in the Dragon Knights series. While I do believe that this book is strong as a standalone, Adora and Jared are introduced in MAIDEN FLIGHT and their romance really stems from there. This book takes on a different approach than the first book. I thought D'Arc really changed the tone of the series with this one. Things are far more bigger in this book - war is approaching and dark times are ahead.Unfortunately for Jared, his life has been in constant darkness since his wife and child died. His grief still lingers within him and he feels unworthy of Adora's love even though she is willing to give it freely. He deems himself undeserving and I think readers will be touched by Jared's gentle heart. Adora gentle coxes Jared out of his shell and slowly learns his ways. As their romance continues to bloom D'Arc really cements the fact that they are meant to be together, a third member is introduced. Lord Darian comes to warn them that death and destruction come their way and though he is seen as a traitor now, Jared welcomes his old friend. Darian takes an immediate interest in Adora and sparks fly between the two. However, as Darian is a member of the royal line of black dragons, Adora is aware that she cannot have something permanent with Darian even though she desperately wants to.D'Arc experiments with the mating rules and rituals she introduced in the first book and I liked seeing the happy ending at the end, but felt that the solution to the conflict seemed to happen too conveniently. I also felt that the romance was slightly impeded by Jared's hesitancy and seemed to fast-track too quickly after when he made the decision to be with Adora to make up for the time lost. Nevertheless, I was enraptured by D'Arc's world. Bringing together dragons, war and love, D'Arc is readily able to transport readers to another time, giving them an escape that they will sure to remember.The se x scenes, again, are very explicit but are well-done. D'Arc explores light bondage and m&eacute;na ge well and am always looking forward to seeing how she will bring three different people together for the purpose of love. She seems to do a stellar job each time.*ARC provided by publisher","09 25, 2012",A1JKGTL51HHTU1,Under The Covers Book Blog,explicit but are well-done.,1348531200

2190,B001DX54F4,"[1, 2]",4,"This review will follow the I-Review format aka Question & Answer format.Visitor: What made you pick up Consumed by Moira McTark?MBR: I was just browsing through Amazon, wondering which title from my massive TBR pile I should read next when this little number caught my eye with its pretty cover. After reading the blurb I had a major case of excitement over the story and the next thing I knew I was reading the preview of the book available on Amazon which just whetted my appetite for more and before I knew it I had hit the ""Buy now with 1-Click"" button and the rest, as they say is history!Visitor: Tell me a little bit about the hero Brian Matthers.MBR: Brian comes from a family of 3 brothers and 2 sisters and works in accounting at Dyson & Dale. Playing baseball in high school had been the high light of his life back then. Brian is intensely sexy and just sheer dynamite when it comes to wooing a woman in bed and out of it and I would love me some Brian as my next ""no-occasion-present."" And on top of it all, Brian has got that tender quality that makes a woman go all mellow on the insides. A man who is not afraid of long-term relationships and commitment, Brian is the reason why we women read romance novels! *sigh*Visitor: Now tell me a little bit about the heroine Amber Grayson.MBR: Amber works as a programmer at Claybourn Elliot and yearns for her own happily ever after though she knows that with the high standards that she has set since high school, the man who would fulfill all her dreams and longings is a long time coming. Amber is beautiful, sexy and knows what she wants and is not afraid to say what she wants as she has gained confidence as a woman over the years though she had been pretty shy in high school.Visitor: How does Brian and Amber meet for the first time?MBR: There is no mention in the novella of how Brian and Amber meet for the first time. But rather, Brian had been Amber's high school crush, a crush that had turned into the center-point of all her wicked fantasies throughout the years. And when a chance meeting at the train station brings Amber and Brian together again, both discover that the incredible pull between them is just too much to turn away from.Visitor: What was it that drew you into the story with Consumed?MBR: Mmm.. Consumed is a pretty well rounded novella that captured my attention and held it from page 1. Reading it one sitting tells just how much the story consumed me as Brian and Amber gave into the explosive passion between them and worked through the hurdles to reach their happily ever after. What drew me in most was the incredible connection that forges between Brian and Amber and even when things head south based upon a misunderstanding, neither Brian nor Amber can turn away from the incredible way that they can make each other feel. That I would say makes for a very heady and enticing pull towards any romance.Visitor: What was it that you liked about Consumed?MBR: As I said earlier, Consumed is a story that refuses to let go once you sink yourself into what's happening. For me, I loved everything about the novella from its beautiful glossy cover to its beautiful yet short epilogue that gave me a sense of satisfaction all around when I finished reading. What I loved most about Consumed was how smoothly the story flowed through, urging me to read on and find out where Amber and Brian were going with their no holds barred sexual relationship. And of course, the creative scenes of passion are just to die-for!Visitor: What if anything would you change about Consumed?MBR: Being a story of such short length, I would say it pretty much hit all the right spots with what the story delivered.Visitor: Any memorable scenes/quotes from Consumed you would like to share?MBR: Incredibly hot was the scene on the dance floor where Brian takes Amber upon her request making all breathe whoosh out of me in one single exhale. And the variety of sensual scenes that Moira delivers, making each one a memorable one is all I can say without giving away any details.Visitor: Who would you recommend Consumed to?MBR: Consumed is an awesome read to squeeze in if you have got around an hour and half to spare. For those who love reunion romances and intense, scorching passion without being overly explicit, Consumed is a definite must-read!Rating=4.5/5Reviewed by Maldivian Book Reviewer","08 5, 2011",A576L6YAOW6IP,"maldivianbookreviewer ""Book Reviews - From th...","Great, hot and quick read!",1312502400

Unwilling to give up her ideal, Amber continues to search for anyone to compete with her memory of Brian.  It is while in between boyfriends that Amber sees Brian waiting for a train. They begin talking and decide to get together for dinner. The chemistry is almost too good to be true and Amber just knows that she will wake up and discover that Brian is only a dream.  Amber's instincts turn out to be devastatingly accurate.  With one misguided statement from Amber's old boyfriend, Brian is gone.Brian Matthers can't believe how immediately attracted he is to Amber Grayson.  The two nights they spend together are two of the most erotic experiences of his life.  Envisioning many such nights to come, Brian is taken aback when he meets the current man in Amber's life.  Brian assumes that he was just a lustful substitute for Amber.  Blowing up at Amber and ignoring her heart wrenching reaction, Brian stonily departs.CONSUMED by Moira McTark almost broke my heart.

However with this one you understand why that is pretty quickly. I understood why Amber felt the way she did as well as why Brian did. There was a pretty good twist at the end as well. It did feel like a grudge match there for a bit but the reasons are again clear. I think she reacted realisticly when put on the defensive. How do you go from having everything you ever wanted to letting it go without a fight. For Brian he had noticed her before but he had not grasped the fact that Amber had him on such a pedestal. It was a stroke of luck that they met again and while he was not happy with how things were moving along he was not going to just walk away from it no matter what it cost his sense of right and wrong.

I think the best part of this book is that it is presented in a new way.It doesn't have the normal plot of jealous ex's or false pregnancy claims on the hero. This book shows how far a family is will to go to follow traditions and what they feel is in the best interest of their family even at the expense of hurting those involved in the deception. It shows how much Luc is willing to give because he regretted his past choices of those he believed wouldn't do him wrong. I loved how Skye wasn't selfish and realized how much Luc was sacrificing, even though he told her he didn't care. It shows how much she truly loves him. She took the initiative to try and correct past wrongs even though they were against her. It takes a lot of courage and love to do what she did. I am so glad that I took a chance at buying this book.I highly recommend this book, especially to those who are tired of the same old Harlequin plots.","05 1, 2012",A3MKDSZ2QPRGM7,Amazon Customer,A highly enjoyable read,1335830400

The fact that it is the debut outing of classy actor Michael Boatman adds to the impetus, but it is the settling in with these nine weird short stories that  makes the reader realize that here is a new writing talent in the making.  The stories could be read aloud and be considered as performance art, so full of wild imaginings and colorful creations, at times repulsively detailed explorations of body cavities and characters who drop in like gargoyles to keep the eye and the senses alert.Where Boatman finds these ideas it at once curious and frightening.  Yet he is able to tell the stories with a superb vocabulary that seems to ooze from the page like a jellied corpse attempting to rise.  There is a lot of violence here, yet controlled with a sense of building tension for the reader to quickly turn the page for more detail.  His 'characters' are flat like comic book figures - until they speak or do perverse and nasty deeds, and then they are strong enough to resemble memories from bad dreams or dyspepsia.Sounds like a book that might be more than the average reader could swallow?  Maybe.  But it is definitely an art form looking for an incarnation and Boatman seems to be able to open and close each of the fairly brief stories like an able craftsman.  If the 'book' feels dissociative, then that may be part of the purpose of choice of format.  Whatever Michael Boatman has created here begs for development into a novel state, and perhaps being committed to a full-length book on one topic would hone the ideas and imagination with the skills he so obviously has at hand.

It wasn't` a quick read, the subject is too sad for anyone with sensitivity or heart to rush through.  I stopped frequently, because I couldn't see through my tears and I couldn't stop them.  Patricia Halloff has written a book as memorable and touching as ""WHERE THE RED FREN GROWS.""  Sissypuss is told from a feline's point of view, utilizing the voices of several memorable cats that were part of the main characters' too short, too tragic life.  It is a book that every animal lover should read and pass on to others in the hope that the world can become a more humane place for all of its inhabitants.I've loved animals ever since I can remember, but my mother was allergic to cats so I couldn't have one until I had my own home.  Since then I`ve always had at least one cat and usually a dog also.  My daughter loved animals as much as I did, but she was partial to cats.  I believe it was because they recognized the loving, proud, independent nature they each shared.I know that there are people that torment animals just because they can and organizations that claim they are doing it as research and I hope that in the future that those who perform these acts will be severely punished here by law and in the afterlife.  I also would like to see the people who dump pregnant or unwanted litters of animals out to die punished severely.  This beautiful book sheds light onto a subject that we would prefer to ignore, but in doing so, we are condemning more animals to a cruel, senseless fate that will eventually lead to death, but not before, they have suffered too long at the hands of their tormentors.**UPDATE: June 2013: After much contemplation, I have decided to change how I rate the books I read.

2233,B001ECQK8O,"[36, 36]",5,"This is a very difficult review to write.  Sisypuss:  Memoirs of a Vagabond Cat by Patricia Halloff is, by any definition, quite an emotional story, and in reading the work, it took quite a lot out of me.  The story is just what the title would indicate; a story of a stray and unwanted cat.  Now folks, be warned.  This is not one of those ""kitty is born, wonders around having adventures, has some hardships, has some fun, and is finally adopted by a loving little girl and lives happily ever after"" kind of book; far, far from it! First though, a brief look at the story line.  I have to be careful here as I do not want any spoilers.Sisypuss is born to a stray mother cat, a mother of many litters who is on the edge of death.  The birth takes place in a cold, filthy unused dog house.  The entire story is told through the eyes of our leading character, Sisypuss.  It is a cat's eye view of the world, a stray cat, an unwanted cat.  Sisypuss is by nature, an optimistic cat, and is always willing to see things in their best light.  The story takes us through a world that is all around us, but one which many have never had a glimpse, nor, for that matter, ever imagined.  From an over burdened animal shelter, to a horrible compound where animals are kept before being sold to ""research"" facilities, into the actual facility (yes, these places do exist, I have had dealings with them), to the open fields, woods and city streets.  This is a grim tale indeed.Ms. Patricia Halloff is an excellent writer.  There is absolutely no doubt she knows and understands the nature of cats. With this work the author is not only giving us a story, but she is making a rather strong statement about animal treatment in this country.  Actually, ""strong"" might not be a strong enough word, come to think of it.  She has been most effective in this effort.  She has used some rather strong street language in this work, but certainly has not used it gratuitously, and she has used it quite effectively.  The author also seems to have the ability to nail the character of many people quite well.  There is not one human character in this work that does not have at least a dozen ""clones"" in every community.  I could introduce you to dozens of them in my area alone.  Historians, sociologists and anthropologists have long pointed out that one of the benchmarks of any advanced society or civilization is how they treat their animals.  I fear we need to take a very close look at ourselves.  I know for myself, one of the first characteristics in any person I meet is how they treat animals and what their attitude is toward them. Now me, being me, if the people I meet do not hit my particular, personal standard, they sort of end up off my ""list"" of people I have anything to do with what-so-ever.  Hey, this is just me though. This work, for me, reinforces my belief that this is a good policy on my part.This is not a pleasant ""feel good"" read my any means.  I can almost promise you that you will feel quite uncomfortable reading it; at least I hope you do.  If you don't, then there is something horribly wrong with you, and you probably need to seek some sort of help.  Now sometimes books that make us feel uneasy are the best kind of books.  They cause us to think.  They can cause us to take action.  They can direct us in the right direction.  They can make us aware of problems that we really do not want to know about, but should.  This is one of those books. When you read this book, it is going to stick with you for a long, long time...I promise!

You might want to call it ""Sissy puss"" and then blush about it, roll your eyes, or laugh, but I can tell you now, this book is no joke. I would say Patricia Halloff's book now ranks in the top five books of all I have read this year.If you are an animal lover, even if you are not; if you have a beating heart that society hardens from time to time, and you yearn for some emotion to remind you just how fragile life really is sometimes, how life could be much worse for you, then I encourage you to sit and spend a night with this book. It is some of the most brilliant, heartfelt, poignant writing that I have read in some time.The name of the book comes from the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a king whose punishment was to roll a large boulder up a hill endlessly, only to have to watch it roll back down. Doomed to repeat this process over and over again throughout eternity, the word sisyphean is often used to described a task that is unending, pointless, and repetitive. Now, think about those words for a moment and think about how perfect they are as descriptions of stray pets, cats and dogs left on the streets to fend for themselves. They fight for food and shelter, fending off prey and sickness, often running away from the hands of abusive owners. Yep, it's a cruel world and the abuse is unending. Enter Sisypuss.From page one, when Sisypuss is born to a sickly mother who is near death , we are shown a grim world with no hope in sight. The entire book is told from the point-of-view of Sisypuss the cat and his outlook on the sinister unforgiving world. Think of the skinny cat you've seen in the alley behind your house, or the animal shelter you pass every day on the way to work. Think of the animal testing facilities that we deny exist. Ms. Halloff leaves no stone unturned when it comes to the harsh reality of the way animals are treated in this country. It is very real. It is no Greek myth.Being an animal lover myself and owning two cats, I have to admit this book is not the happy fairytale cliche I was probably expecting. It is, however, a wake up call that the treatment of animals is something we should be concerned about.  Those of you who may not like books with animals as the central characters, don't stop reading now.There are humans in this story, but their central existence as secondary characters only serves the purpose of showing the relationship between humans and animals, as pets, and the delicate boundaries between our world and theirs.  But again, these plot lines are no walk in the park.  Booley, Sisypuss's main owner, is battling drug use.There is an array of other characters, both human and animal, that will definitely keep the pages turning.  At times, Halloff's vivid writing will leave a coppery taste in your mouth.  Your chest will hurt from your heart crying out.  You may even hang your head in shame for not doing anything to help our furry friends.  But above all this, you will come away from this book never once regretting the time you spent reading it.  You will learn something, and hopefully we'll make change.  Bravo to Patricia Halloff because her clever and informative writing demands that change!","08 17, 2008",A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,"Shannon L.

The story, as told from the cat itself was incredible, well written, and totally believable. I have owned several cats in my life, all of which I loved, and should have treated better, and this book reminded me of them.This book tell the story of one cat, the main character in the story. It is not a fairy tale, it tells it like it is. I think even it tells it better than the fate of many cats who are used even today for animal testing. It has some good spots, and some truly sad parts that will make you cry.The book has left me very emotional, as it will do to anyone with a heart, not just cat lovers. This book is a stand out book, which stands above those I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon. If I could give it 6 stars I would, because it truly deserves that. This is a book I think should be compulsory reading in schools, in the hope that it changes the way people treat animals for the better.Really worth beyond 5 stars, and a book that will probably stay with you for your entire life.

2259,B001ET66ZE,"[0, 0]",5,"This is quite a strange book that I still have trouble to classify. First of all the main hero, Brock, was straight for two/third of the book and then he didn't fall in love physically for the other hero Carey, but rather he decided that Carey is a good man, better than all the other people around, and so he wanted to stay with him. On the other hand, Carey was the same, he didn't fall for Brock as a man, but rather as the image the man is for him.Brock is a poster boy of the past; in his early twenties his career is just finished, burnt like thousands of others in the modeling world. He is broken and without a place to stay, and he has no friend to turn for help... and maybe he doesn't want to neither. Then he meets Carey, a 32 years old independent wealthy man; Carey is strange, but he is gentle and caring, and he offers to help Brock for nothing. Neither Brock or Carey are gay, and Carey's offer raises not from a sexual interested, but more from an esthetically point of view: Carey is a wanna-be photographer, and he really likes Brock's easiness in front of the camera. So from their bargain, both of them will have what they want, Brock a place to stay and Carey a free model.When I say that I found strange this book, is due to the fact that for most of the book, Brock is regretting his lost sweetheart from high school or remembering his sexual experiences with women; never he lusts for Carey in a sexual way, if not with a light comment on Carey's muscular body after their exercised together, like a buddy friend could do in a gym.Also Carey is not easy to understand. I believe he helped Brock out of a need for company, he is lonely and without a real interest in life, and play the role of the Good Samaritan with Brock could give him a sense for his life.The book is rather short, less than 80 pages, in fact it's a novella, not a novel. But as I said I find it puzzling but not without interest. So puzzling that pushes me to browse the net to find info on the author, Dan Skinner, and I found a Dan Skinner who is a romance cover artist (like Carey) and who started his career helping a buddy friend with his modeling career (like Brock)...","10 2, 2008",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Coverboy by Dan Skinner,1222905600

(Small Spoilers Follow): Brock, who is the down on his luck model, made a sex tape with his heiress-celebutant ex-girlfriend. This apparently ruins his career. Hmmm. That seems unlikely given that Kim Kardashian has made an entire career out of having a huge butt and a very well distributed sex tape (Thanks Mom!). So....I didn't get the big deal. The sex tape is described and it's not as though young children or sheep were involved so I'm just not seeing it.There is no HEA either, always a downer for me.Overall I just wasn't invested in the characters and I didn't buy the plot.

Despite Jessica's refusal of his proposal a year ago, he's decided that she belongs to him and he'll do whatever he has to in order to make her feel the same way about him.Jessica Evans has no illusions about who she is or what she wants in her life.  Her own background taught her that the only person she can count on is herself.  The only trouble is she has very strong feelings for Wade which no amount of denial seems to assuage.After Jessica shot down Wade's proposal he hightailed it out of San Antonio for Arizona to lick his wounds.  She'd claimed that she simply isn't the marrying kind but he's not willing to lose hope just because she's obviously scared of a commitment.  Wade approaches her at the auction stockyard where Jessica works as the manager and is hurt that she acts like she hasn't even missed him over the past year.  He's well aware of her sexual appetite and fully intends to use it to his advantage.  Jessica loves kinky sex and by having multiple partners she's been able to keep her distance emotionally - or so she thinks.  Wade can barely stomach sharing her with anyone but Clancey, Jessica's longtime friend with benefits, gives her a perceived safety net.  Wade has known Jessica since high school but he knows very little about her past and the secrets she's guarded so closely.Just when Jessica thinks she can hold Wade at bay her past comes back to haunt her and she finds herself face to face with a smaller version of herself.  Thanks to Clancy Wade had a bit of forewarning that Jessica didn't have a happy childhood but he never anticipated coming face to face with the man who made Jessica's childhood a living hell.  Is Wade prepared to accept Jessica along with all her `baggage' and can he convince her that she can trust him to never purposely hurt her - physically or emotionally?Oh my!  I have to tell you that I don't believe I can adequately express the emotional roller coaster I experienced while reading BOUND BY THE PAST.  Jessica and Wade's relationship is full of ups and downs and some unexpectedly heart wrenching scenes as Jessica has to decide if she's going to trust Wade or not.  The reason behind Jessica's refusal to allow anyone close to her is stunning and heartbreaking but it makes her a strong character and someone that women could admire.  Out of all the characters in this story it's the secondary characters who bring it to life in a truly unique way. My heart broke for Clancey.  He's suffered his own disappointments and his feelings for Jessica go beyond friendship though it doesn't appear that he realizes that until it's too late.  I cried for him more than once while reading this storyBOUND BY THE PAST is the second book in Ms. McKade's TIES THAT BIND series. BOUND FOR THE HOLIDAYS was the first book . . .  and now I'm praying that we'll see at least one more story to add to this series.

He had always been the one that just wanted to have fun, but things were different with Jessie.  He wanted to possess her, and make her his - his alone.  He was tired of sharing her with her with their childhood friend Clancy, and doing everything her way by her rules.  At Christmas he had made the colossal mistake of proposing which sent her running.  Wade knew she cared about him more than she was willing to admit, so he would just ease her into their relationship slowly to give her the time she needed to get used to it.Jessie had made a pact with her best pal Clancy when they were kids to never marry.  They had both had abysmal childhoods, and had plans to never repeat what they went thru.  She was terrified because Wade brought out feelings in her she had never experienced, and was afraid of.  Clancy knew she loved Wade, and even though it broke his heart, he pushed her where she was afraid to go.  Directly into Wade's loving arms.Wade never dreamed that their life could be so good.  He finally had the woman he had wanted for all time, and she was all his.  While Jessie was still a little new at loving and having a family, he could tell she was born to be part of his large family.  When her horrible for an excuse father showed up on her doorstep, and dumped his small daughter Shelby on them, he knew immediately she was meant to have a family of her own.  Just when they thought everything they ever wanted was in their grasp, Jessie's father showed up threatening to take Shelby away along with Jessie's heart.Jessie had never allowed herself to believe in anything permanent because in her experience it always fell apart, and so she never gave love or family a chance.  Wade helped her to see what was possible if you allowed love to touch your heart.  While the encounters between Wade, Clancy, and Jessie were hot, you always knew where Jessie's heart belonged.

She can enjoy the dominance she craves in the bedroom, but on her own terms.  But Jessie's safety net is torn away from her when Wade Peterson asks her to marry her.  Though she turns Wade down, Jessie still can't get him out of her mind.  And if the struggle to tamp down on her feelings for Wade wasn't hard enough, Jessie's past soon resurfaces with additional complications that unsettle her hard won control.Wade is crushed when the woman he loves rejects his marriage proposal.  However, the sexy-as-sin cowboy isn't about to give up so easily.  He might be willing to share Jessie with Clancy to keep her, for now, but the desire to have Jessie only for himself soon becomes too much.  Will Wade be able to win Jessie's trust and show her that true love and happily ever afters can exist?Mackenzie McKade does it again!  Bound by the Past is an emotional, engaging, sensual read I could not put down.  Wade is meltingly sexy, patient, dominant, and loving - the epitome of the perfect hero.  In the hands of a lesser author I might have become frustrated with Jessie and her determination to stay distanced from Wade.  However, Ms. McKade made me understand Jessie's fears and sympathize with her.  I adored her and loved watching her grow into someone who was able to accept love and give it in return.  As for Clancy, Jessie's best friend and the third in the couple's threesomes, he has me crying out for his story.  He's kind but tormented, supportive of his friends but in need of someone to love him and help him overcome his own past.Bound by the Past is the second in the Ties That Bind series, but can be read as a stand alone.  There is a brief mention of the hero and heroine of the first book, Bound for the Holidays, but having not read that book (yet), I don't feel I missed anything for this particular tale.  I dearly hope Ms. McKade continues this series with books for Clancy and Wade's siblings.At turns tender and titillating, Bound by the Past is a book I Joyfully Recommend.  Ms. McKade delivers a fantastic, blazingly hot tale with characters that will capture your heart and a romance that is truly sigh worthy.Shaynareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","10 7, 2008",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Bound by the Past- A Joyfully Recommended Title,1223337600

It was interesting to read that he was married at a very young age - I never knew that, and the complexities of that marriage made him seem more real. There were points where I almost felt he looked down on black South Africans, like it was wrong for white South-Africans to treat Indians poorly, but a totally different story all together with how they treated Black people (i.e. one night he was taking a walk down a South African road and was berated by a white man. One of Gandhi's white friends caught this and got mad at the white man for berating Gandhi. Gandhi said something to the effect of 'Oh forgive him, he just thought I was a black man') - this is paraphrased, but you get the just of it.Still, his determination and fight for Indians to be treated equally was inspirational. His peaceful protests are what eventually inspired Martin Luther King and, to a point, Nelson Mandela, fight for the rights of blacks in America (King) and South Africa (Mandela). So for that, and for refusing to accept the racist status quo for his people, Gandhi was an inspiration.","07 11, 2013",A1GQ96G63ZEIJ0,Amazon Customer,A bit long-winded but he was still an inspirational figure,1373500800

It fills in some gaps in historical knowledge, as all historical novels do, with speculation.  This makes the story flow. And at the end we are not sure but that Montezuma's Treasure may have been left as this story suggests.The book combines this adventure with a modern-day search for that very Treasure. And this takes place in tandem. We get a little of the current story and then we switch to the historical one and follow that. Intertwined.  This can be disconcerting.  Just as you get involved in Mexican border wars we switch to conquistadors on horseback.  But I thought this just made the whole better.And add to the mix the frequent transcriptions of a Mexican talk-radio reports to move the action along.Clever literary devices that will can spark your interest.The author has managed to tell the story of La Malinche and the Spanish Conquest and to describe the potential of a Mexican government melt-down while providing a colorful description of the heritage of the Americas.A terrific read.","08 23, 2010",AVHACTPAGE53N,geoff thomas,A historical novel of Montezuma's Mexico with a current events thread,1282521600

She contives to steal the tablet and conduct the search herself.  Thus far, we have an action and intriguing story like Clive Cussler's tales.But then, the story just keeps getting more afield, weirder, including an attempt to place Maggie as the new Princess of Mexico. Interspersed through much of this is the historical tale of La Malinche, from 500 years before.  Frankly, after reading some of it, I lost interest and just skipped those portions.In short, I find this long, long tale quite unsatisfying.  It rambled, didn't make much sense, and the characters didn't interest me, nor the history.  One off-putting thing for me was the extensive conversations about sex (especially by the women) but no actual sex scenes or romance at all.

If that's not bad enough, Griffin Hilliard also has spent the last four years on the run from hired killers. Griffin's psychic and empathic, and his family believes he may have discovered secrets they were trying to keep and now want him eliminated. When killers do finally catch up to him, shoot him, and are about to finish the job, help comes in the form of a sympathetic vampire named Jarrah.It turns out that Jarrah is not a very good vampire because he still maintains a respect for life and a desire to be human. Not wanting to see an obviously decent Griffin wasted by hired thugs, he dispatches them with brutal efficiency and takes Griffin home to heal him. What neither expect is a deep physical and emotional attraction to each other.This attraction surprises Griffin because he's not gay. He's never even been tempted by men before, but something about Jarrah calls to him. At first he thinks he may have been drugged, then he thinks it may be vampire ""glamor"". Griffin is aware of vampires as the time he's spent on the run, and his psychic abilities, have shown him that these legends do exist. He's well aware of their ability for mind control and believes Jarrah is using it on him. Jarrah then uses some to show him what it's like, and now Griffin is faced with the fact that his attraction to Jarrah comes from within.Jarrah has spent the last 67 years closing off his emotions. When he was turned into a vampire, he lost his loving older brother and his loving partner, who betrayed him out of fear of what Jarrah had become. Jarrah now just exists, feeling neither pleasure nor pain. But the attraction for Peter is so great, emotions start stirring again, and he thinks he may even feel his heart beat at times.The story is flawless. Dialog is natural and intelligent, the plot moves along at a perfect pace to keep the reader engaged and interesting, while still giving each scene sufficient detail. The characters are nicely developed with their own unique traits, both good and bad. The story builds to an exciting conclusion as Griffin faces his killers, and the details and outcome seem organic and natural. While erotic at times, it's not vulgar. The scenes are passionate, sexy, erotic, and very very nicely written, never being overbearing. The setting is interesting in that it falls into the camp of science fiction, but still maintains a comfortable level of familiarity with our current world so that the science fiction aspect doesn't overshadow the romance and excitement.It's absolutely a five-star male romance story.

Gabriella and Drummond were in love twenty-five years earlier, when an unbelievable act of betrayal--which had me in tears--rips the young lovers apart.

When Drummond learns about the ""wife sale"" he is determined to have Gabriella as his own...he's never forgotten his first love.  However, once he secures possession of Gabriella he is determined to strip her of her ladylike inhibitions--Drummond refuses to be trapped in another passionless marriage.  In his endeavor to release Gabriella from the chains of ""proper"" society, Drummond assumes the role of Dom, and demands that Gabriella submit to his will (FYI, I would not classify this as a BDSM romance, although it does include a mild aspect of BDSM.)  Gabriella, not privy to Drummond's thoughts has no idea of his hidden agenda.  She just thinks he's an autocratic male, who is intent on humiliating her further.  I absolutely loved this book.The story that unfolds is not very believable, considering the events that unfold and the fact that they take place in Regency England, but that didn't bother me in the least.

Beam Piper didn't invent the parallel universes concept, but he did more than almost anyone else to popularize it.Piper's Paratime is an infinite band of parallel Earths, each splitting off as the result of a decision somewhere in history. The resulting levels range from uninhabited Earths to Earths with high space-faring civilizations. And one of those Earths discovered how to travel between these worlds.Of course a paratime traveling civilization opens the possibility of all sorts of mischief and requires a police force. Since the Original Time Line has exhausted its resources, it needs paratime travel to obtain the resources it requires to continue to exist. It's the job of the Paratime Police to keep order among the paratimers and to keep the Paratime Secret at all costs.These stories are built around the career of Verkan Val, paratime policeman extraordinary, and his efforts to help his culture keep the Paratime Secret. It's not an easy job. In the course of these stories Val has to recover a Venusian Night Hound that has been let loose on our timeline (late-40's Pennsylvania to be exact), get his sometime-wife Dalla off a world where reincarnation is scientifically proven fact before she overturns the entire civilization, and battle a gang of trans time slavers whose roots reach into the very heart of the Original Time Line government itself.Most of these stories originally appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the late 40s and 50s. Like most Astounding offerings, they're full of high action against well-thought-out backgrounds and spiced with interesting characters. It makes for a colorful offering.Although Piper had been writing science fiction for more than 15 years, he didn't attract real notice until his last Paratime story, Lord Kalvin of Otherwhen, and the unrelated Little Fuzzy. Unfortunately, depressed by financial troubles, he committed suicide just as his career was taking off. It's good to have this collection to help remember H.

The church I was saved in had a business meeting in order to fire one of the pastors. My parents supported all the pastors but we were in the minority. The meeting became very heated until finally we had to run out of the sanctuary. People became ugly fast and chased us, even shooting a gun into the air in the church sanctuary. They literally ran us out of town. We moved and my parents joined the First Baptist Church but didn't attend church very much and finally not at all. They didn't lose their faith in Jesus Christ but they lost faith in the church (and my Mom was the daughter of a minister). As a teenager, I began attending a small church with some friends but the older people of the congregation resented being overrun with teenagers. It disrupted their placid spiritual life so they fired the preacher and all the teens left that church. My husband and I joined a church in 1983 and attended until 2009. We were very active. But of all the pastors that went through our church, I could probably count on one hand the ones that didn't abuse the congregation in one way or another. Finally, we had a straw-that-broke-the-camels'-back event and we left our church. Needless to say I'm gun shy now! We've been visiting churches all over our town but haven't found a match yet. I think I might like one but only to get anxious that we would invest our time, money and selves into a body that has the same problems. It takes awhile before you get to know the church, policies, leadership, congregants enough to know if all is well or something is rotten in Denmark. I had almost made up my mind to be like my parents and just drop out of the church scene and worship God in my own way. Then I read this book. I think the book's description is right on the mark so I won't repeat it.

She has one great kid and one delinquent and she is beaten down by her hubby and shows more annoyance than concern for her kids who obviously are dealing with their dysfunctioanl family in their own ways but need help. She takes crap from her husband, her kids, and pretty much everyone. The hero works for an environmental agency and sees the man's wife and smiles at her after which they go to infatuation and love.OK, if she is so terrified of her husband and doesn't have the nerve to leave him, where is she getting the nerve to have an affair on him in front of the whole gossiping town (her tramp friend takes her to dinner and they are seen by everyone eatting with the hero and his coworker)? Honestly, I'm not one for infidelity, even if she is cheating on her abusive/cheating husband - LEAVE HIM. I get that he is this controlling powerful guy, but if she is afraid to leave him, what does she think he'll do if she is cheating on him? This was compared to Bridges of Madison County, but it is not anywhere near as good as that - it may be about infidelity, but it does not have the same intensity - it's just not written as well.

Regina was a very complex character; she still has a little bit of self-worth left and it was struggling to emerge under Quinton's attentions. Wayne was a perfect example of how total power leads to total corruption; he is thoroughly evil. Quinton's great-aunt, Whispering Feather (I loved that name!) was marvelously wise and had a very generous spirit that reached out to encompass Regina as well as Quinton. And let's not forget Quinton's dog, Hurricane and Regina's dog, Fury; they had wonderful personalities, as well.This was a very well-written book although the proofreading could have been done better.

I just wish there had been an epilogue so I wouldn't have been left not knowing what happened to anyone.********spoiler alert******** I was very angry that Regina blamed herself for not fighting back sooner, especially when it was clear that the only reason she was able to prevail against Wayne's violence was because of the two dogs protecting her.

He works for a company that assesses the environmental impact of logging operations, but life and tragedy long ago caused him to set aside his idealistic, green principles. Regina is married to the boss of the logging operation, a man who pretty much owns the town of Crow's Landing and doesn't care who he tramples in his pursuit of success and financial gain. Throw in Regina's troubled teen, Michael, and Quinton's part Native American heritage and the conflicts start to pile up, especially when Regina and Quinton meet and the spark between them cannot be denied. These two troubled souls can't ignore their attraction for each other, despite the risks. Their budding relationship renews their enthusiasm for life and gives them both hope that happiness is possible again. But the tensions in Crow's Landing reach snapping point and when the logging mill burns down, somebody has to pay. The plot is complex and fast paced, and kept me up late turning the pages to find out what happened. There are some great secondary characters, especially  Hurricane and Fury, the two dogs.

Quickly the pair runs into the Templeton family at a restaurant in town.  With just one glance, Quinton knows that Regina, the wife, is the woman of his dreams.  The only problem is that Wayne Templeton owns the logging company that Quinton is working with and the fact that Wayne, with his money and respect, basically owns the town.  Quinton doesn't know how Regina feels about him so he goes about finding out.  They decide to meet for dinner the next night and they both feel an attraction for one another.  So while Regina's husband, Wayne is out of town, she and Quinton carry on a loose affair, trying not to be noticed.  Then trouble begins.  Someone has been vandalizing areas of the mill and someone is setting Quinton up for it.  While avoiding the town cops, Quinton and Regina's relationship intensifies, especially when Quinton learns that Wayne is verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive to Regina.  He only wants to take her away from such a horrible husband.The story comes to a peak when the cops come to Quinton's door with evidence that Quinton has done the vandalizing.  Quinton isn't guilty but the problem is that Regina is his alibi.  Needing to work things out in his head, he escapes to the nearby American Indian reservation that Quinton grew up on.  Quinton has been away for a long time but his aunt takes him in and gives counsel as to what he should do about his problems.  He needs to talk to Regina.The closing of the story is where I don't want to give spoilers but the reader finds out who is doing the vandalism when the last act is a huge one.  Quinton doesn't want to lose Regina, he wants to be her white night.  With the cops still thinking he is the perpetrator, he walks right up to the cops and is arresting right away.I don't normally read this kind of romance novel, but it was a freebie on Amazon so I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.  There was some depth to the story.  Much more so than the Harelequin Romances of old.  The characters could have been more fleshed out and there were a few typos that need editing, but I did like the story.  I found myself rooting for Quinton and Regina.  It was hard to believe that they weren't caught by someone seeing them out, but they weren't.  I do have to mention that the ending was highly unbelievable and disappointing. But now that I have invested myself into this story, I want a sequel to see if the author can redeem the terrible ending to this story.  I do hope Carolyn McCray writes it so I can find out what happens to Regina and Quinton.  3 stars.","11 18, 2012",A19GP20DYUOKVW,"Regina Niesen ""Gina""",The story is ok until the end,1353196800

2466,B001H55R8M,"[5, 7]",3,"This is the first book I'm reading from Carolyn McCray but I already know I'm going to be reading more. Yet I have intensely mixed feelings about this book; it has the basic elements of a romance novel and it goes way beyond that. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a psychological thriller but if I did, I wouldn't be far off.Regina was married off when she was 16 years old. She has two children and a bully of a husband who she can barely stand. Quinton is an environmentalist hired to do an Environmental Impact Assessment for the logging company owned my Regina's husband.Quinton should be the antithesis of all Regina stands for, with his mixed heritage and his tree-hugging ways, except he's not. Strangely the pair are drawn to each other as Quinton represents a fantasy which has before now, been beyond Regina's reach.In getting to know Regina, Quinton begins to rediscover himself and regains contact with a major part of himself that he'd lost touch with. While all this is going on, life does not stand still.Quinton and his charming assistant, Ralph become implicated in a vandalism case, the townspeople are less than welcoming to the strangers and there's the nearby reservation where Quinton has strained relations, or so he thinks. Not to forget the husband, of course. All in all, there's just so much tension that I couldn't help taking frequent breathers from the book.Generally I can't stand stories that have infidelity in them and that seems to be the main theme in Indian Moon. Forget that Regina was told by the old elder on the reservation that she was not married in her ""heart,"" and the fact that she was also hinted that Wayne, her husband could have maybe broken his vows to her; I'm not sure those are reasons enough to excuse infidelity.One thingIndian Moon: Love Isn't As Far Away As You Think (Real Romance...For the Rest of Us)does is challenge the reader. I certainly found myself shifting uncomfortably as I read and as I found myself being drawn into the lives of Regina and Quinton (and getting to like them to boot); I couldn't help but remember that even though these characters might be fictional, they represented the effects and choices we all take every day.So no, I did not fall in love with Indian Moon; it certainly won't be one of those books I re-read until they fall to pieces (or the Kindle falls to pieces, whichever). However, I did fall in love with the author and will recommend her books, including this one","07 15, 2012",A26AZKV79LWYK3,"Shaz D. ""Shaz""",Engaging But Evokes Mixed Feelings,1342310400

It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love.

Quentin is struck by his young partner's willingness to take chances, to reach out to other people, to women no less.  Ralph leaves everyone in his wake smiling and feeling good about themselves, from the hostess in the local barbeque joint to the battle-axe receptionist who ends up giggling at the incorrigible young man. Ralph's antics remind Quentin how long it has been since he's felt joy and pride in his life much less caused it in others.Regina is caught in the ugly and dispiriting cycle of an abusive marriage. She stands as if at a distance watching the effects it has on herself and her two children. But she feels helpless to do anything but keep the simmering violence from escalating.When these two lost and dispirited people meet something happens that changes their lives and all of those around them.  They fall in love. But if love doesn't necessarily conquer all, in this case it forces the protagonists to wrestle with deep painful questions.  When did they begin letting others make critical decisions for them? When did they stop being honorable?  Stop asking what was important to them? What they wanted to do and to feel? And when did they begin to believe that nothing they did could make a difference in their lives or in others.This is a thoughtful, challenging story. After al,l it deals with the issues that make can either break or make a person. As Quentin and Regina tentatively explore their feelings for each other they are forced to deal with issues they have caused and ones that they have let happen. They learn that love is worth fighting for. Even more important, they learn that honor, dignity and being true to who they are is the greatest gift they can give to one another and to themselves.","06 30, 2012",AO3FOFDRFYSQ6,windigo,Love is worth fighting for,1341014400

The story was previously published inThe Black Dagger Brotherhood: An Insider's Guide, so if you don't do e-readers it's still available to be read.  Or, if you do have the Insider's Guide you already have this story and don't need to repurchase.As can be told by the product description it gives more detail about Zsadist and Bella--the main characters from the third novelLover Awakened (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 3)If you have not yet read any of the BDB series, this is NOT the place to start, you should really start withDark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1).  Following the way many paranormal romance series are published, each title in the series features a main character who happens to find his/her fated love.  With a lot of angst and hot/detailed nookie involved to make it interesting.  That said, this series is fabulous in that aspect--JR Ward does a great job with her world building and each story continues an overall plot arc.  Each tale is also good at keeping tabs on favorites from other books.  Because there is a lot of story arc going on it is pretty important to keep going in order.This novella was not integral to the story told in Lover Awakened, but clearly more Z/B was needed.  This is a wonderful, prolonged, epilog in a manner of speaking.  Truly a wonderful read and I hope she does more like this to keep us up to date with the other characters.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (both this and the whole series!)JTG","03 12, 2011",A11WYHDB1YEZOX,Jackie-the-Greyhound,"Some stories beg to be told, and this is one of them!!!!",1299888000

It appears to be her style and the book's not a romance, so there's nothing wrong with it. It just isn't for me. So, when I found out about this book, I had to have it. I adored this book. I loved getting the deeper look into him and I loved having that final closure for him, watching him truly heal from his wounds. Very sweet book. If you read any of this series, read Zsadist.

I highly recommend the entire series to dark urban fantasy readers.  IMO, the first three books in the series classify or closely classify as hybrids between dark paranormal romance and dark urban fantasy and the rest are dark urban fantasy peppered with a bit of romance.

If my pure love for them wasn't enough, add those scorching sex scenes and you got a banger baby!!I love how this story focused solely on them. With exception for the chapter that gave us a brief view on the Doc, it was all Z and Bella with Nalla. They are the cutest little family, and who would have thought that Z would have been the first to carry on the line of Aghony and the aristocrats? Not me!It was like watching Z and Bella fall in love again. It also gave us an update and dose of reality as to where Z is in his recovery. He's not as far as I suspected at the end of 'Lover Awakened'.  He s struggling and with even more baggage.Even though Mary has paled quite considerably since 'Lover Eternal', the brothers never take a weak female. As such, it's good to see the fruits of Mary's labour and I always love it when she and Z get together. Whether learning or therapy, those two got a rhythm that no one else has with Z, not even Bella. Maybe it's her training, but Mary definitely knows how to handle him.I don't know T.W. and we might never see him again, but I love the man and what he stands for. His moment with his wife was precious, and was a slice of life outside of the supernatural, something that has been missing and slipping as this series grow.An update was also provided on the other members of the brotherhood, however minimal. Phury is back how I remember and respect him, even if he isn't fighting, and it was good to get back out in the field with the brothers. Their tactics and battles always fascinated and intrigued me. I loved 'Dark Lover' where we got more fighting than romance. There was plotting, scheming and failure. I secretly would have liked at least some action from Mr. D, but then again, this novel was about love, reconciling and building new bridges.I searched without seeing a book for Nalla, but I already love the young and anticipate spending time with her uncle Rehvenge in the next novel.

2555,B001HZY846,"[35, 42]",5,"Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.  And ""Jane Austen: The Complete Collection"" brings together the full complement of Austen's, from her little-known nonfiction to the classic bestseller ""Pride and Prejudice"" (and everything in between) -- lots of lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.The collection includes Austen's most famous six novels, which explore love, societal demands, honor and independent thought -- a girl meddling in people's lives, two sisters with completely different romantic approaches, an ""old maid"" whose fiance returns to England, a poor relation whose moral standards are challenges, a hyper-romantic gothic-novel fan whose imagination runs amuck, and a slow-blooming love between a proud man and a prejudiced woman.That's normally where people's acquaintance with Austen ends. But she actually wrote a number of other things -- a brilliantly manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes; her ""History of England""; two unfinished novels, ""The Watsons"" and ""Sanditon""; some letters; and some bits of her juvenalia, including some funny early spoofs and her ""scraps.""This collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Her main novels are all love stories, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment), and a biting, sharp-edged wit. But we also see her more openly comedic side (""Love and Freindship,"" a parody she wrote early on).And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen's writing was brilliant -- there's a bit of roughness in ""Lady Susan"" and ""Persuasion,"" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (""The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows""), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (""I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine""). But she also writes some intensely romantic moments as well (""Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you"").Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: quiet, shy older men, sexy clever ones, blunt ones, generous honest ones, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).""Jane Austen: The Complete Collection"" draws together almost all the work that Jane Austen ever produced, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines. Brilliant, and a must-read for any reader.","06 15, 2011",A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",Tales of Jane,1308096000

2561,B001HZY846,"[76, 83]",2,"REVISED 05-06-13: My initial inclination was to rate this set 4 or 5 stars until I realized it TOTALLY and consistently ignored Austen's use of italics in all her major works. Where Austen italicized a word for emphasis, this Bedford edition doesn't do so. Nor does it use all caps to equal italics, nor even before-and-after underlines (_like this_) the way some other editions do. When this was priced at only a dollar, some readers might have been willing to overlook this defect (if they were even aware of it), but now that the price has doubled to $1.99 (the same price as 2 superior editions in the Kindle Store), one shouldn't have to. I consider this a serious enough flaw to rate this Bedford edition only 2 stars (and as a fan of Jane Austen, I was sorely tempted to even rate it one lower).Some readers of this review may wonder why I consider this worthy of criticism. I do because Austen (whose wonderful works rate 5+ stars) was a true wordsmith; she meant precisely what she wrote and the manner in which she wrote it. The words she chose to emphasize contribute to the way she intended her stories to be read and understood. Since she is not excessive in her use of italics, when she does so it is significant to the precise nuance or witticism she is trying to put across. That's why it IS a big deal. Without italics, something of Austen is lost. Reputable print editions all have them; why not all ebook versions? Why not THIS one?Except for this defect the Bedford Park edition provides easy access to each title and to the chapters within each title. It provides the finished and unfinished novels plus a sampling of juvenilia. And the formatting is fine--except for the aforementioned lack of any indication of emphasis throughout (a defect which seriously mars an otherwise fine set).One can get virtually EVERYTHING Austen wrote for the same price ($1.99) from Delphi and from Palmera. (To see for yourself, type ""Delphi Austen"" or ""Palmera Austen"" in the Kindle Bookstore searchbox.) Delphi uses italics in 4 of the 6 major works; Palmera in 5 (so I lean toward Palmera). I did NOT recommend this Bedford edition when it was priced at only a dollar, and I do not recommend it now at twice that.","02 18, 2012",A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,Librarian,Bedford Park edition has a serious flaw,1329523200

The last thing she expects is for her old flame Billy Buchanan to be brought in to evaluate and decide the fate of the community center.Billy isn't quite prepared for his reaction when he first sees Eden again.  He last saw her ten years earlier when he ran from the temptation of a sexual encounter with Eden after the prom.  He's been brought in by Feather Light Consulting to evaluate the Community Center which should be a completely unbiased review but his reaction to keeping his feelings for Eden and his opinion on the state of the building separate may prove to be very difficult.Things quickly heat up between Billy and Eden but she's not looking for a happily-ever-after.  Billy has his own life in Illinois and he'll return there once his job is done.  There's nothing wrong with indulging in a little mutual pleasuring while they're together though, is there?Popular drummer/singer Jon WhiteFeather, Eden's friend and sometimes lover, has just come off the road and returned to town and the situation seems to be easy enough to handle since they don't have any expectations of each other.  Eden even tells Jon that she is seeing someone and agrees to meet up with him later and bring Billy so that the men can meet.  Unexpectedly, Jon and Billy meet before the `date' because Jon and Billy just happened to be staying in the same condo.  They form a fast friendship and the evening goes much smoother than she'd even hoped.  The only downside are the snide petty comments and racial slurs of from a couple of women whom Jon and Billy turned down.Eden's so hurt by the comments that she wants only to leave the bar and return home to `lick her wounds' but Jon and Billy have different ideas.  They take her to the condo - originally just to talk so they could find out what upset her so much but then once they start comforting her... well, let's just say Jon and Billy have no qualms about making a girl's fantasies a reality so that she feels like she's the most desirable woman in the world.Billy hurt Eden deeply once; dare she hope that she won't get burned if she allows herself to admit to loving him?  What will happen if his recommendations for the community center aren't what she was hoping? What about Jon?  Will he be willing to give up the `friends with benefits' role he's been playing with Eden?Lorelei James's contribution to the MENAGE & MORE anthology delivers quite a storyline with wicked situations, a fast paced plot, characters readers will care about, and of course lots of down and dirty sex.  WICKED GARDEN delivers an unexpected pang to readers hearts as you read about the community center and the importance it plays in the lives of so many in the surrounding area.  Eden, Billy and Jon's liaison works on so many levels but the thing that really stands out in my mind is it's based on friendship first and the respect they share for one another is almost overwhelming at points.WICKED GARDEN is a wonderfully endearing story.

Billy Buchanan returns to Spearfish as a favor for a business associate.  He agreed as a favor but also because it would give him a chance to re-ignite the spark from his high school flame Eden LaCroix.  For the past ten years he has regretted walking away from Eden. Eden has spent the last ten years building a career and dedicated to the local community center helping at risk kids.  She hasn't had time for real relationships, just the occasional no strings attached hook ups with sexy Native American rock star Jon White Feather.When Billy and Eden see each other for the first time in ten years the chemistry spikes off the charts but Eden is determined to fight it because Billy is working on a project that could destroy her job.  He quickly sweet talks her into seeing him out side the project.  As things heat up between Eden and Billy and they are both realizing they still have strong feelings for each other...dunh dunh dunh....Jon comes home for a couple of days.  Billy and Jon decide they want to give Eden one of her darkest fantasies. BOY O BOY is this a hot menage!I really like Eden, even though she is worried about her heart and Billy leaving her again, she takes charge of her sexuality and is not scared to go after what she wants sexually.  As much as I liked Eden in this story, it is Billy and Jon who stole the story for me.  Both men are sexy and strong.  Billy is possessive, sexy, dominant and vulnerable, I absolutely adore the way he treats Eden and some of the insecurities he displays.  JON...oh my, he is my favorite, don't get me wrong I love Billy, but the way Jon treats Eden before, during and after the menage just melts my heart (among other things), Not to mention Jon is a sexy rock star.

She couldn't believe her eyes because the last time she had seen him he had literally fled, leaving her with her prom dress around her ankles at the Motel 6, ten long years ago.  She hadn't missed the almost physical relationship they had, but the friend that she trusted and confided in.Billy had reached a crossroads in his life.  He was at the top of his game in his professional life, but nothing else in his life satisfied him.  When he was asked to consult on a project in his hometown, he jumped at it.  Eden had never been far from his thoughts, and now he was going home to claim the woman made for him.  He didn't expect this to be an easy journey for him because his treatment of her so many years ago had been nothing short of abysmal.  His behavior was only one barrier keeping them apart, and the other was that his decision on the community center would have such a huge impact on Eden's life.  Billy could very well be stripping her job out from under her if his recommendation is to condemn the current building housing the center.  With all the issues circling them, Eden tried to resist the pull she felt toward Billy, but it was inevitable that they succumb to the intense heat between them.Eden is a strong character that has not had an easy life, but the loss of Billy was one loss she never recovered from.  Billy realized his error in judgment early on, and was back to claim the woman that had held his heart since high school.  While Eden scrambled to keep her armor in place, Billy did everything he could think of to penetrate it.  Well-rounded characters, but the story is not up to the caliber I expect from this author, but still an enjoyable read.","11 22, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Wicked Garden,1227312000

Unfortunately she's learned the hard way that the wild guys she prefers don't provide the stability she desires in a relationship - and she's positive that there isn't a single man out there who has a combination of dependability and wildness that will set her girly parts on fire.Alexa's indulgence in a little high-speed joyriding results in a race with a gorgeous man riding a Harley and a sexual romp she won't soon forget.  Only once she realizes what she's done she's embarrassed by her own actions and leaves the scene of the indiscretion without disclosing her name.  All she knows about him is that his name is Justin, he rides a Harley and his lovemaking is exactly what she craves.Having engaged in such a naughty act, Alexa is understandably distracted but with a major contract depending on her presentation she does her best to pull it together.  The last thing she expects is to see Justin enters the boardroom and introduce himself as J. Winston.  He's dressed impeccably in business attire and acting like he's never seen her before.  Alexa's furious that he would deceive her in such a manner and once the business meeting is over she unleashes her rage on him. She even goes so far as to turn down his offer of the job.  What Alexa doesn't realize is that J. Winston and Justin are not the same person but they do know each other - and because Justin has been searching for her since their dalliance letting her get away now simply isn't going to happen.The chase is on and fortunately J. (Jay) Winston and Justin arrive just in time to save Alexa from an attacker in her parking garage.  Alexa is stunned when she realizes that J. and Justin aren't the same person but what's more disturbing is the attraction she feels for both men.  Add the reason for Jay's silence about the details of his project and it's exactly the sort of situation an adrenalin junkie craves.  Dare she hope for a happily ever after with two men or is she just courting heartache once again?Jayne Rylon's NICE AND NAUGHTY captured my attention from the moment I opened this book.  It's so easy to imagine yourself in Alexa's place as her need to protect herself wars with her desire to throw caution to the wind.  Jay and Justin are simply irresistible.  They're very different and yet similar in so many ways that I envy Alexa - she gets the best of both worlds - NICE AND NAUGHTY - in herspecial men.NICE AND NAUGHTY is a definite must read for those of you who enjoy menage-a-trois romances.

She was completely thrown for a curve when she faced him knowing this was the man she was presenting a proposal to on behalf of Therber Management Services.  She couldn't believe that he didn't even acknowledge meeting her before, and even told her he was pleased to meet her.  This presentation was too important, so she put on her game face and went on.  Alexa wasn't going to let him ruin this for her with his cruel games.When the meeting concluded, Alexa couldn't get out of there fast enough after confronting Justin about their steamy encounter.  She raced home to cool off, but as she gathered her briefcase from the car, a man grabbed her from behind and jabbed a gun in her back.  She tried to struggle and get away, but he had her.  Alexa thought it was over until someone came to help in response to her screams for help.  The next thing she knew she was in another car with a rugged looking Justin tending to her wounds, and the intense businessman she had just met driving.  She demanded to know what was going on, and was flabbergasted to learn she was in the presence of Jason and Justin Winston - twin brothers.What a steamy suspenseful ride!!  There is story with intense passion, and together that always makes a winner.  Jason is a strong controlled dominant man while his twin is laid back taking things moment by moment.  Jason and Justin know immediately that Alexa was the woman for them, but she has been hurt in the past, and isn't as easily convinced.","11 19, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Nice and Naughty,1227052800

At times when he was reading as the men his voice became a bit mechanical but it either stopped or I got used to it because I didn't notice it as much toward the end.  Moving on to the writing-I am not sure how I haven't read this one from Jayne yet.  I've read most of her books and I have this on my signed shelves but I guess I missed reading it.  lol While I can tell that it is one of her earlier works she still has that same Jayne sparkle shining through.  Started off with some seriously HOT sex on the roof of a car and moved into a threesome.  It was a bit cheesy at times but that happens in most romance.  The steamy hot sex makes up for the cheesy times though cause it's seriously smoking hot.  There is also a bit of nerd factor going on with lots of technical aspects surrounding an invention they are trying to protect.

2591,B001IP0UVA,"[5, 5]",4,"Amanda Young is one of my ""sure thing"" authors whose books I pick up when I want to be guaranteed a good read. I've read most of her books, and so far I haven't found anything I didn't like. Her characters are realistic, her love scenes are hot without being purple or cheesy, her narrative is smooth, her dialogue is natural...she's just a great writer.This is a hot little novella (50-odd pages) about a guy that finally decides he's done with women. The same day he decides to act upon his same-sex fantasies, he runs across the younger brother of an old friend. Sparks fly, things get hot, and the rest is history.I admit the ""supposedly straight guy turns gay"" story is one of my guilty pleasures. I know it's not the most realistic scenario, but it's one for which I'll gladly suspend disbelief. I love the secret glances, the tentative touches, and the ""so wrong but feels so good"" angst. If I had one complaint about this particular story, however, it would be that the transition was little too quick for my taste. In this case, though, it's obviously more of a word count limitation than intentional rushing. It's difficult to capture the psychology of coming out in 50-something pages, so you have to understand beforehand that a short story like this is going to contain the highlights rather than the full experience. If you want a short, sexy e-book and have a couple of bucks to spare, buy this. Or just make it simple and buy Amanda's entire backlist.","12 4, 2008",AL6WDE46RJ9I3,Amazon Customer,Taboo Desires by Amanda Young,1228348800

The actions of the Hero and his father were anything but alpha through most of the book, it seemed at the end, they both pulled their heads out of their butts and got it together. On the Heroine's side of the story, I got the tri-bond issue, I understand it and it was depicted well in this book. I didn't like the fact her own sister didn't try to comfort the heroine while the jealousy and other issues were brought up. It seemed the sister took the side of the Hero's way too much.

He lives as a human and prefers it that way. Megan has embraced her ""otherness""; she is a werewolf and proud of it. When fate mates them, they need to find a way to deal with their differences, or live apart.Comments:- A reasonable length book (2650 kindle locations).- Preceding books followed a ""Werewolf Mafia"" story arc. It was wound up in ""Standoff"". ""Fated"" would standalone, the other books are not necessary for the enjoyment/understanding of this book. However, as characters from other books appear and play an integral role in ""Fated"", reading the books in sequence would be of benefit.- ""Fated"" begins 2 years after ""Standoff"".- Shane was Layla's anchor inReluctant. He has not appeared in other books. Megan is the last Warden sister of the Cascadia Wolves Pack to be mated and is Lex's Enforcer.- The earlier books in the series (other than ""Reluctant"") mixed the action/suspense of the Pellini arc with romance/wooing/angst of newly mated relationships. As the war no longer exists, ""Fated"" is all about the relationship. It is chock-full of emotion, angst, hope, heartbreak. And lots of sex. No violence, no shooting, no war.- Sex is m/f with a very HOT m/f/m encounter. Sex is all loving, generous.Opinion:Yes, I like this series of books. I think Dane brings originality as well as humour and love to the Shifter/paranormal genre. The sex is always HOT and the characters are always well-defined and interesting. The women are STRONG, physically, emotionally. They stand up for themselves and don't let anyone walk over them. The men (heroes) are Alpha, they want their women to be protected. But they always love and celebrate their strengths, differences and power. Shane, in ""Fated"", struggles with the differences, because he struggles with his own. But Megan knows who she is and what she wants and fights for it.

She does a good one on him mentally and due to his Fathers love of his mate, he allowed it without saying anything until the damage was done.Thus begins the story of a sucessful Doctor, who lives as a human, and wants his mate to join him.  Megan, who is Second and Enforcer for Cascadia cant live away from her pack, wont live that way no matter how much she loves her mate.Will love overcome?  Will her mate learn to accept and love his wolf, or are they destined to live worlds apart and in pain for the remainder of their lives?  It is a story that has it all, and like all of the Cascadia Wolves stories, I would recommend each and every one of them!We need more Cascadia Wolves!!","03 13, 2010",A1ZAPFF4YQ4IPJ,"Shelbie Knight ""Shelbie Knight =)""",Another great for Cascadia and Lauren Dane,1268438400

At least, he says he's simply trying to finish a massive project at work and doesn't have any energy once he returns home. Still, that's no reason for him to completely ignore the new lacy bustier or her hot Brazilian way job.  When he does make time for sex, he either falls asleep in the middle of the act or opts for his own solo sessions.  If he's not cheating on her, then he's obviously lost interest in her.  What's a girl to do?At a friend's housewarming party, Melina confesses to a friend that there's trouble in paradise.  Knowing that Melina would never flirt with another man just to make her boyfriend jealous, Abby instead suggests that she flirt with another woman--her.  Flirting soon becomes much more and when Gavin walks in on the two women locked in an intimate embrace, will he finally realize that he's been neglecting his pretty girlfriend or will the girl-on-girl scene be too much for him to handle?Love Me is a well-written, blisteringly sexy short story by author Kelly Jamieson. It explores the fantasy many women have of loving another woman, even if for only one night.  The concept of daily living getting in the way of intimacy and paying attention to one's mate is hardly an unrealistic concept.  However, while flirting with and acting upon a flirtation with someone of opposite sex is considered infidelity in this story, it seems to showcase the message that sex with a same-gender partner is not.Having read other words of lesbian or bi-sexual romance, I was looking forward to an entertaining read. I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the cavalier way that infidelity was handled. Fully recognizing that this is a work of fiction, I still had difficulties believing that these two people could not communicate to each other their own wants and needs.  What's more, due to that lack of communication, under the guise of making her boyfriend jealous, the heroine went to another woman to have them met, even if the encounter began as a simple flirtation.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews ([...])","01 15, 2012",ATNPFCCWHQWJJ,"Bella March ""Bookaholic, Book Reviewer""",Love Me,1326585600

This book wants to be erotic but really it's just sex and the sex isn't that interesting after awhile.  There is no character development, the plot is more than simplistic.Basically, the guy goes into the Tyger version of a heat.  He needs sex and he needs it now.  The spacecraft needs him to pilot so they ask for a volunteer.  A female Tyger from his planet volunteers.So they have sex, domineering sex that gets old after the first two times. He treats her like convenience.  She resents him but wants him. And could the character please stop saying the word pussy. The pun was old after the first 10 times.  The guy gets well enough to pilot, his heat ends, he dumps her, she is broken-hearted.He ends up missing her after all and decides to take her back.  She says yes. The end.Really.  No plot.No depth of character.The male character is unlikable.So that's what I have to say.  This one is a not worth the three dollars.If you like these types of books, read Lora Leigh's Mercury's War, Megan's Mark, Dawn's Reckoning.  Those three are much better than this one.

You can also view my blog atreadersedyn (dot) blogspot (dot) comReview:I read Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryght as few months ago and am only just getting a chance to write the review. As I recall, this was the first sci-fi, paranormal romance I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Ms. Cade does a fantastic job of creating a believable, futuristic world of alien species and technologies dreamed of. While there is a lot of language used, somehow it fit. I suppose I can attribute such raw acceptance to the fact that this is a science fiction novel. Within my mind, as far as science fiction goes, anything goes. You just have to be open-minded enough to be able to both accept it and recreate it in your head. But I am no strange to the realm of science fiction. In books yes, but not with television. My Dad raised me on Star Trek, so from a very young age I was exposed to all types of creatures. It is kind of funny to watch the original Star Trek series now when you see how far we have come with special effects. As I got older I watched shows like Stargate: SG1, Farscape, all of the Start Trek spin-offs, and many more. But I digress. I believe my point it that such an exposure has allowed me to broaden my mind when reading outside of the box.Maybe I should get back to the book now. *coughs* Ahem. So Tryon is a Tyger and has been caught off world and mid voyage in the middle of his mating shift. Needless to say, he needs sex and lots of it - fast. The consequences could mean the deaths of many crew members should he be unable to satisfy the sexual need deep within. Calla is also a Tyger and took notice of Tryon when the voyage began, but when he looked right past her, her hope for a tryst faded and he instead became the object of her fantasies. Now she is the only hope for the crew and, well ... Tryon's only hope to regain control and ability to perform his duties.I can honestly say that I really enjoyed the time spent reading this story. It was the first time I have read Ms. Cade and I will definitely be back to read more of her work. Perhaps even within this series, The Orion Series. From what I found on the publisher's website, Tyger Tyger is the first book in the series with 5 books currently published. I wanted to share some other excerpts with everyone, but I am guest posting and thought I should try to keep it clean. I don't mind saying that I had one heck of a time finding passages that were ""clean"". This story is loaded with graphic sexual encounters, and dang! Let me tell you just how smokin' hot they are! Good lawd!That said, even with all of the sexually descriptive scenes, Ms. Cade manages to craft a workable storyline between them. I liked that Tryon is an alpha male that is unexpectedly paired with a strong female. Calla gives as good as she gets most of the time and inevitably, this dense alpha finally gets the clue that he likes it. Unaccustomed to females giving him attitude, Calla well and truly rocks his world. And in the midst of all of this is another component to the story. A group of terrorists has snuck on board and plans to sabotage the ship. The intruder is eventually left to Tryon to sift out. Meanwhile, Tryon makes a muck of his relationship with Calla. Seems crazy, right? A shifting male Tyger, his unplanned female mate with sass, a saboteur on board, the fate of many depending upon it all, crazy amounts of hawt sex, and a potential future relationship gone awry by the ever-present male without a clue. Yeah, I know. But it works and I was completely entertained by it. I mean if a shifting male Tyger and loads of awesomesauce sex don't grab you, then I really have no idea what else I could dangle in front of you. It is not a deep story that is going to explore the inner angst of the main characters, but it is entertaining at the very least.(Digital book purchased for personal library)","01 30, 2012",A3SQ89T9RQM0G5,EdynzTrybe,Super Smexy Sci-Fi,1327881600

While he's in this state though, he can't help any one.  The only thing to do is get him a temporary mate...Calla knew from the first moment she saw Tryon that she wanted him.  When he went into heat, she was the first one to raise her hand to help.  Even though she is also a Tyger, she has no experience with heat, and soon finds herself with more than she may be able to handle.The story line is definately something I was attracted to.  This is an Erotic story, so if you are looking for a light romance, it's not the story for you.  There is a lot of sex of course, because after all, Tyron is in heat, and that's what he needs.Calla and Tryon do have chemistry, but for me it wasn't enough to see them together long term.  The bomb seemed more of a distraction than anything, and I don't think there was enough time spent developing the relationship between the two main characters.  That's really why I gave this story three stars, I also felt that it was a bit choppy in the writing style.

However, he never thought it would be thrown off so badly that he would go into his mating shift while on board.  Now the most important thing on his mind is not his job, but finding a mate, on the ship, to mate with immediately before he is forced into a lust-induced rage.Calla Fellura, a female tyger, signed onto the crew as a novice interpreter, never dreaming that she would come face to face with a male tyger that would become her entire world.  When the call goes out to all female tyger employees to see if anyone can help, Calla immediately volunteers.  Once locked in with Tryon, Calla realizes that there are lots of things about a shift-mating that she never thought about.If the asteroids and a mating frenzy aren't enough for Tryon to worry about, an eco-saboteur has endangered the entire ship and Tryon will have to come up with a way to save it.  When the ship arrives safely, will Tryon sabotage what he and Calla have found or will the Tyger be able to claim his Tyger lily?Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryght is not only engaging and red hot, but it has the ability to suck in a reader.  Calla is very inexperienced sexually, but knows she has to go to Tryon when his mating shift happens unexpectedly.  Tryon would never have approached Calla under other circumstances, but now he knows that she is not only his shift mate, but maybe his soul mate, too.  When Tryon and Calla first came together, it was very erotic and for me it got even more so as the story went on.  Reading and watching as Calla and Tryon came to know about each other and discover that what they felt was not only because of the shift, kept me turning the pages rapidly.  I will admit that I was disgusted with Tryon for a small amount of time, but then Calla showed him just how a true Tyger lily handles a dense male.  I loved the ending and found it perfect with how Calla and Tryon met.  Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryght is a must read that you won't want to put down even after you have finished it.

There was lots of male-dominated animalistic sex, some development of feelings, and even a little danger and death mixed into the &#34;plot.&#34;  It is a short story, so the plot is minimal and there is little character development.  Honestly, everything outside of the main characters getting it on seems more like an afterthought.  The one thing that really bothered me is the ending, though.  After the guy & girl get together, they go back and eveal that the bad guys' plot has been uncovered and thwarted, but it doesn't say how.  It seems to me it would have been cleaner to leave the resolution at the disposal of the green guy, or if it's a plot-continuation part for the next book, at the corporate guys in the ship.  The news report just seems hasty to me.Spoiler Alert:  A Tyger navigator is the only one who can safely program the Nav computer to get the ship through a dangerous asteroid belt, but because of unforseen delays our hero is cought onboard during his mating shift without a woman.  A female Tyger with a secret crush on the hero offers herself as his sex-slave, basically, while he is in shift so that he doesn't go crazy and so he can nav the ship.  Predictably, she falls for him even though she knows she shouldn't.  He falls for  but doesn't really get it.  Meanwhile, there's a terrorist plot to blow up the nav computer onboard and thus crash the ship into the asteroids.  The terrorist plants his bio bomb, which kills the nav computer.  He then tries to escape thru the arboretum where the lovers were holed up.  He sees the chick naked and tries to run past while Tyger tracks him down.  Tyer catches him and rips his throat out after questioning him briefly.  Tyger decides to manually steer the ship to the planet- a feat which hasn't been done in the last 100 years or more, and becomes a hero when he's successful.  Unfortunately, he offers to set the girl up as his mistress.  She takes off and he sulks for weeks.  Then his parents make him realize he should marry her even though she isn't from the upper class.  He runs off to get her to find she is on a ship and has just gone into heat.  He goes to her, and you can guess the rest- he asks her to promise to obey, and she asks him to cherish her.  Oh, then there was some little scene where we see the brains behind the terrorists being upset that it didn't work, and we learn that it's not about Ecoterrorism at all (which was hinted earlier), but rather about eliminating the competition of another shipping co.  In the very end, there is a news announcement that the plot was uncovered, but no details as to how or by whom.Overall, a decent read for a fee novella, but I might have been less kind had I paid for this book.

First she thinks she sees a large dog streaking through the snow-covered yard. Then, she can't find the spare key where it is supposed to be, so has to break in. Then upon entering the house she is attacked and accused of being a burglar. It sure doesn't help matters any that the man holding her is the most gorgeous man she has ever seen!Gabriel Hawthorne is at Kaitlyn's house installing a security system when he captures an intruder. He is surprised when she turns the tables and attacks him, saying he's the interloper. Even more surprising is the fact his wolf discovers the little spitfire is his mate! She is human though and Gabriel does not like or trust humans. How can she be his mate? As the two are snowed in together, passion burns bright and the wolf learns Perception is everything.Perception may take place during winter, but the heat Gabriel and Abby generate is enough to melt even the deepest of snow! Passion is fast, hot, and bright once the sparks between our lovebirds start flying. Gabriel is all alpha male, his wolf nature coming out, hard as a rock if he has to be yet willing to do anything to make Abby his, even in spite of his doubts about a relationship with a human. The sexual tension between them skyrockets, and when they come together, look out!Abby has a history but has made concerted effort to overcome her past and make a good respectable life for herself. Gabriel has no love for humans after the one he was closest to turned her back on him years ago so he swore never to get involved with a human again. Upon meeting Abby, his whole outlook on life begins to change and he realizes that there are humans in the world worth knowing and loving.Don't let the short length of Perception fool you. Patrice Michelle packs so much emotion into this story that you'll be wrung out by the end. She does a fantastic job of bringing her characters and their world to life so that we see them as real people, not just characters on a page.

That doesn't stop her from being extremely attracted to two of her bosses, Jon and JT.  She's heard the rumors about them sharing women and is trying very hard to convince herself that she isn't interested in the two of them - together.Jon and JT have no qualms about their lifestyle or the fact that they want to make Christina a part of it.  The problem is that she's so skittish that getting close to her has been impossible - until now.  They've enlisted the aid of her friend Aislinn to help make Christina more comfortable with them.Aislinn is aware of Christina's aversion to men and alcohol but she also knows Jon and JT well enough to know that neither man would hurt her and judging by Christina's relaxed demeanor when the men are around she knows it too.  Since Christina isn't about to trust any man enough to start a romantic relationship, Aislinn suggests she indulge in a fling - just to get them out of her system.Christina follows her instincts and allows herself to be seduced into Jon and JT's bed for a sexual encounter she'll never forget.  Hours later she's awaken by the ringing of her cell phone only to receive the devastating news that her mother has died.  Christina's positive her father's abuse is what killed her mother.  Neither man will allow her to contend with her family alone.  Christina is going to have to come to grips with her feelings for them and learn to trust them - with her heart and her well-being.  She just may learn that there are some men who are not a complete waste of skin!Annmarie McKenna's THE STRENGTH OF THREE is more than a smoldering romance, it's a glimpse into the lives of children brought up in abusive homes as adults.  I really have to admire Christina for not only having the strength to stand up to her father and brother but for being brave enough to give Jon and JT a chance.  She's obviously afraid of history repeating itself but figures a fling with Jon and JT is safe enough.  Jon and JT are wonderfully alpha male and so intent on winning Christina's trust that it makes you smile just reading about them.  As for Christina's father and brother, well you'll love to hate them and the situation that led to Christina's mother's death.  Plus I have to tell you I got a real kick out of JT and Jon kidnapping Christina's guard dog to bring it to their home so she'd feel safer with them.  I can just see this huge dog going for these ex-military's gonads, too funny.If you're curious about Aislinn's story and haven't done so yet, be sure to pick up a copy of TWO SIGHTED.

It starts off with a battle and the action continues throughout.  The author has created a post apocalyptic fantasy world with a unique twist and very engaging characters.The heroes, Marc and Blake, and the heroine, Kate, find themselves fighting on the same side against the demons set on destroying the world.  The emotional drama the characters find themselves in draws the reader into the story as Marc and Blake join Kate's military group to try to close the demon rip, and find themselves attracted to Kate. They each try to get her attention as they deal with their own personal issues with each other. Kate is equally attracted to them both, but doesn't know what to think or do about that, besides she is on a mission and doesn't need the complication.The reader's attention is also captured by the depth the supporting characters add to this drama filled story.  The well written battle scenes come to life in this intriguing tale and you can feel the chemistry building between the three main characters.  The sex in the story is very hot and leaves the reader wanting more.The author leaves us with not only a war cliff hanger, but a romantic cliff hanger as well, but she left us a great spot in the story.

While being familiar with the other series is NOT necessary, the writing and characters in this will have you searching out the other stories: this will certainly help to provide more insight into the connected worlds.Characters are beautifully defined and described, with personal insecurities and preferences that are easy to relate to and understand,  with conflicts  occurring as characters seek to overcome their differences and fears to make connections that are both imminently destined and oh so right.

All of Kallysten's work that I have read as of yet as been wonderful.This one took me a bit to jump in, and get the bearing and surroundings for some reason. I had a cold for a bit, so maybe it was just that.Marc and Blake are vampires. Marc being the Master and Blake being his Childe. The setting is in the future when Pacts are no longer formed or mean much of anything. (Pacts are where vampires keep humans safe and in exchange they give vampires blood.)(To learn more about Pacts see Kallysten's series titled The Pact) Vampires used to keep humans safe from the demons that roam the earth. There seem to be more and more demons roaming, this is caused by rips in the reality. Marc and Blake are looking for the rip when they come across some human fighters who are in need of assistance. Of course humans nowadays aren't as trusting and fear that these 2 vampires might be working with the demons. so it takes some time before a little bit of trust is formed.Amongst the group of fighters is Kate, who both Marc and Blake find attractive and desire. Kate is slow to realize it, but she too has an attraction to not just one of them but both of them. Although there is ground work set for more with these 3, there isn't much in this book. (can't wait for the next one and the one after that, as it will be about these three, but back to this one first.) They fight together and the start to trust one another, and slowly build more of a foundation.The vampires and the humans main goal becomes to find the rip and get it sealed, so they move on to a new town and start once more. Slowly making earth a safe place once again. There is hurt, and some betrayal, and enough lust to make you want more. Once the story gets going, its hard to put down, it just seems to fly by and before you know it its over and your wanting the next book so you can continue on with their journey and see what more is to come.","09 29, 2013",A2KLQK4ZXC7WDB,Heather,Blurred Trilogy part of The Demon Age,1380412800

2712,B001J6OUZA,"[0, 0]",4,"I think before I began Blurred Nights I was expecting a high heat m&eacute;nage type of vampire story, perhaps similar to the On The Edge series, also by Kallysten.  If I had to classify this book, I would say straight up Urban Fantasy with just a hint of romance.  To be honest, it took me quite a few chapters to not look for sex around every corner, behind every fleeting glance.  And that is totally on me and my dirty brain.  This book is also number five in The Demons Age series, which I have read none of them previously.  I did not feel as if I were lost, but I do wish that maybe I had read other so that I could learn more about the demons themselves.In Blurred Nights we have Marc and Blake, Sire and Childe.  Friends and lovers.  I liked both of these men quite a bit and found their personalities complimented each other well.  Where Marc is by the book and strict, Blake blazes his own path and makes the rules as he goes.  Apparently there are issues in their past, and I don't know if that is covered in another book or not.  But this has definitely caused some trust and abandonment issues between them.  While they are out hunting demons, they happen upon a group of people, and they end up going back to their compound with them.In this group is Daniel, the leader, Simon, the mage, and Kate, a soldier of sorts.  There are others, but their parts are generally smaller.  The main issue of focus here is Kate, and she sort of finds herself in a bit of a triangle with the vampires, Marc and Blake.  I liked Kate enough.  She is a strong woman, stubborn in her ways, and when she loves, she does it all the way.  What I would ultimately like is for Marc, Blake, and Kate to be thrown in a room with no doors to figure their hearts and wants out without escape.Like I said, I would consider this book Urban Fantasy.  There were some romantic kissy moments, and there was even some sex (of the Marc & Blake variety). It was mostly about the war with the demons.  Now the demons... that is where I think I could have benefited from reading previous books.  Were they mindless killing machines, or were they intelligent killing soldiers from another dimension?  Did they think for themselves, or were they driven by a singular command?  I'm still not entirely sure.  One thing I do know is that they are pretty badass and just bad. I definitely wouldn't want to meet them in a dark alley.So did I like this book?  Yep.  I sure did.  After I got out of the mindset that it wasn't all about the nookie.  That took me a moment. Would I recommend this book?  Absolutely.  Kallysten always has this free flowing familiar style to her writing.  It's always easy to follow and very descriptive.  She creates these whole worlds around these characters, and you feel like you are right there in the deserted and foggy streets with them.  Add that on top of compelling characters and the drama she injects into every story, and you've got yourself a hell of a book.","09 29, 2013",A1A7YPC6UBZZIY,Liz @ Fictional Candy,Exciting story!,1380412800

The world is described with  enough detail to really come alive for me but not too much to ever get boring. It was fast paced and there was plenty of action yet at the same time there was a lot of character development where you got to know everyone, especially Marc and Blake.You feel Marc and Blake's love and protectiveness for each other but also frustration, annoyance, disappointment, betrayal, rejection and much more.  They and their emotions feel very real. Marc is more mature and responsible than Blake (and is his Sire) but he has made mistakes in the past which have damaged their relationship. Blake has a lot of insecurities when it comes to Marc. He has  trouble taking anything seriously and has a lot of growing up to do. Even though they are powerful vampires they have some human flaws which make them real.There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.Even though it is clear the story will continue it ends at a good point so the story still feels complete in its own right. I would definitely recommend this story.","09 15, 2013",A2I58O8E2AVBZM,madpuss,Great story,1379203200
2715,B001J6OUZA,"[1, 1]",4,"3.5 Stars3/5 Hotness RatingKallysten has created a truly unique universe for her stories and this is only the second of her books that I've read that has been set in The Demons Age. I think that the setting and storyline for this time period is very exciting and adds a unique twist to an already fascinating world.Marc is a vampire that believes in the long ago made Pacts with the humans. He and his Childe, Blake, fight the demons but Blake does it because he thinks it's fun more than anything else. One night while they were fighting they came across a group of human fighters and decided to join forces with them. Among them was a soldier named Kate to whom both found themselves attracted. I guess it was game on between those two from then on. There's nothing like a little rivalry when vying for a woman's attention.The relationship between Marc and Blake is something new to me. I've read a decent amount of Kallysten's creations and I've never come across a Sire/Childe relationship quite like their's before. The parent/child feel isn't there. Marc doesn't force Blake to obey in any way. In fact, Blake's a total pain in the ass. He's always trying to push Marc's buttons and he's awfully immature despite his many decades of life.The three main characters in this book were written extremely well. To put it simply, the were brought to life for me through Kallysten's words. It was like I was watching the story play out before my eyes. I was able to feel Kate's confusion over her conflicting emotions for the two vampires. I disliked Blake's childlike behavior towards Marc. When Marc felt exasperated by Blake's antics I was right there with him and I can easily envision myself smacking Blake upside the head. I love it when a read feels real like that.Since this is only the first in a trilogy about the same set of lovers, a lot of the book was built on the character building. As you can tell, I think Kallysten did a fabulous job with it. I missed the smoldering love scenes though. The scene between Marc and Blake was brief and the other scene in the story was only a murky dream. I look forward to reading the next book and getting deeper into the attraction between the three.","04 21, 2012",A3N7QZ5S5FQ4CN,Meggerfly,A Good Start,1334966400

Marc and Blake have their own special bond as Sire and Childe and I can't wait to see how all three character's relationship progresses.

She needed to find another position, and it was the only way to make it to the job conference.  What follows next is a near death experience that changes her life forever when a gorgeous vineyard owner rescues her.Atticus Maxwell is a vampire enforcer who's lived for centuries, yearning and hoping for the One to bring meaning to his life.  Meeting Lissa knocks him out of his ennui once he's awakened to an all encompassing love.  Could she be the One he's searched for?  Once it's learned that the accident was no accident, Atticus does everything in his power to ensure that Lissa stays alive long enough for them to explore all the possibilities.Most of the vampire novels I tend to steer towards are usually dark, violent, brutal and brimming with lurid sex (think JR Ward), which makes them not quite as emotionally romantic as One and Only.  This delightfully sweet paranormal romance carried an ""R in Romantic"" timeless vibe.  Sure the sex is sensual, at times even naughty, but the amiable warmth here is old school.  It's not in the bodice ripper class; there's definitely violin and piano music serenading reader heartstrings.Atticus is noble and honorable with that air of Byronic tragedy that makes him vulnerable without being a stuffy wimp.  When he opens his heart and life to the equally lonely and engaging Lissa, I was so glad they finally found one another.  There's a tender thread throughout that works well with themes of friendship, loyalty, and hope, as well as the continuing battle of good vs. evil.  All in all, I was left with a pleasant feeling, which means I'd like to see where this series goes.  Bianca D'Arc does well setting everything up for the next series installment, and I'm positive that she'll more than deliver on it.

Now, after having resigned himself to not finding her, after debating the final sleep and turning further and further away from existence, he steps on a girls toes and his entire world changes.Lissa was feeling apprehensive about taking the shuttle bus up the mountain, but she got on anyway. Slightly psychic, she's feeling very uneasy until she sees a man who literally robs her of breath and makes her heart race. Suddenly those psychic warnings are blaring conflicting messages and when he trods on her toes and looks into her eyes, Lissa knows she'll remember that fantastic stranger for the rest of her days.A tragedy leads them to each other and dedication to each other will see them through to eternity.It's not the premise to this short novella that I have a problem with. It's perhaps not the most original of stories, but it has a bunch of sexy male vampires in it, and that's pretty much all I need to enjoy a short story like this. Unfortunately, it was just about every other aspect of the story that made me wince.I think D'Arc had some sizzling sex scenes in the book that are deliciously graphic and temperature raising, but that's where the good points end. The dialogue is so unbelievable, so cliched and trite and way beyond soap opera-ish that it actually hurt to read some of it. I totally don't get it. I've read D'Arc before and didn't have that problem with the book, but this one was quite literally painful.The development (and I use the term loosely) of the relationship between Atticus and Lissa was nearly comical in its speed and lack of anything resembling realism, and the 'conflict' of the story arc was...just bizarre. If that wasn't bad enough, it ends with a cliffhanger, and I have a huge issue with cliffhangers. They're in my top three of reading anathemas. At this point not even a life threatening cliffhanger could prompt me to continue with this series, though I did like the interaction between Atticus' friend Marc and Lissa's friend Kelly.

She was in the middle of a heated argument with one of the club bouncers - and in Parker's opinion holding her own against the muscle bound hulk.  Parker intercedes and invites Cyn to join him in the VIP room and proceeds to enjoy a stimulating conversation with her all the while loving the fact that she's either clueless about his fame or simply doesn't care about it.  Parker's determined that Cyn is the woman he wants to share his life with and Cyn who's never considered dating white men is rethinking her `policy.'  Before they can truly get to know each other or exchange information, Cyn receives a call from Miller and has to go see to her friend.  He's run across his ex lover and is very upset.  MeShell and his love of cross dressing annoys Miller but he still sticks around to make sure that Miller is okay and get the goods on where Cyn had disappeared to at the nightclub.  Cyn doesn't discover that Parker is so well known until MeShell hands her a magazine with his picture on the cover.  Dare she dream of a happily ever after with her own `Prince?'You'll fall HEAD OVER HEELS for this modern day Cinderella story.  Lena Matthews had me chuckling my way through this quick witted and charming story.  While Cyn and Parker's story is captivating and kept me eagerly reading to find out what would happen between them.  It was the secondary characters, MeShell and Miller that I absolutely adored.  MeShell's vivacious nature and Miller's down to earth serious personality seem to clash yet there's a bond between them that is prevalent throughout the story.  They're the most unlikely of `fairy god mothers' but they do it with such style that as a reader I had to cheer them and their friendship with Cyn.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","03 10, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

Brody loves Sidney and sharing her with anyone would never have even come up if he hadn't noticed that some of her preferred reads involve m&eacute;nage relationships.Drew Buchanan isn't the settling down kind of guy and he never stays with any one woman for very long.  He leads more of a nomadic lifestyle and often sails off on his yacht aptly named `Sunset.'  He's a brilliant desert chef and creates his delectable treats for Brody's restaurant, The Blue Fish Grill, whenever he's in Graceville but he's finding it harder and harder to stay in town especially since he's in love with Sidney.Sidney McCall has always lived a nomadic lifestyle.  Her mother never stayed in one place very long and she simply continued the lifestyle she already knew - until she met Brody.  They quickly moved from the initial meeting to living together and even a year after the fact, Sidney still feels like it's all a dream.In celebration of their first anniversary together Sidney plans to surprise Brody with a delicious meal along with a sexy outfit when he returns home from the restaurant - and succeeds.  Brady had intended to tell Sidney that he'd invited Drew over and about his surprise but one look at her in her sexy dress and all his brain cells headed south.  Dinner's put on hold while they satisfy other hungers - until they hear the knock at the door and then Brody remembers that he still has to tell her about his `gift.'  Sidney can't deny an attraction to Drew and even though she isn't entirely comfortable with the idea of sex with two men at the same time it is a fantasy of hers and if it's alright with the men then who is she to argue.  Things turn decidedly odd afterwards and Sidney's not sure what to think about Drew's cold disinterested attitude and to make things even more complicated Brody notices her preoccupation and assumes that it's more than just friendly concern.Sami Lee delves into what could happen when the thing you fantasize about turns out to be the exact opposite of what you truly desire.  Sidney and Brody are deeply in love with each other but neither of them are truly certain of the others feelings.  I found the dynamics between these three characters to be oddly fascinating but at the same time understand why Drew's held himself apart from Brady and Sidney.  I'd love to know what happened with Drew after this story ends.

More importantly, he had the love of his life Sidney McCall, and they were about to celebrate their first anniversary.  Drew thought the perfect gift would be to indulge one of her deepest fantasies of a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Brody Nash.  He wanted nothing more than to give Sid everything she ever wanted, and keep her happy.  While he loves her with his entire being, she has never reciprocated his declarations of love, and that left him dreading for the other shoe to drop.  He was afraid that maybe she didn't have as deep of feelings as he did.Brody Nash was the true definition of a free spirit.  He was an immensely talented desert chef, but couldn't keep his feet planted in one spot for any length of time instead choosing to sail off at any given moment.  He loved women, but never kept any of them living up to his bad boy reputation.  He had no real relationships except the one with his best friend Drew.  They had a special bond usually reserved for close brothers, and that was exactly how he thought of Drew.  When he asked Brody to be the third for a special anniversary celebration with Sid, he couldn't believe his ears.  Surely, his best friend was not suggesting that they share the women that had possession of his soul?  When Brody finally agreed, no one was prepared for the ramifications to them all caused by their combined actions.This was a moderately entertaining read, but not a keeper.  The characters are not fresh, and the story falls flat.  Drew had no business initiating a m&eacute;nage into a relationship he was so unsure of.  It screamed of desperation on his part, and he deserved everything that happened to him.","01 7, 2009",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Chasing Sunset,1231286400

Sukie was always the little sister tag -a- long.No one knew she fantasized about Eamon since oh, like forever and same goes for Eamon with his hidden feelings for Sukie.What started out as a no strings attached one night stand offer from Sukie to Eamon-then it's let's go back to just being friends--turns into the expected results that generally follows the ""friends with benefits"" incident.No strange circumstances or elaborate plot lines, just good 'ol fashioned tender heartfelt romance. (with nice-not trashy- sex)I loved Eamon from ""Hello"" and Sean's love for his sister is well portrayed. Sukie is written like someone you want to hug and make your best friend forever.

This was the case with Sukie O'Leary, her brother Sean's friend Eamon Houlihan was that teenage crush, and hew was now ranked as one of the best goalies in the National Hockey League. What she didn't know is that Eamon had noticed years ago her growing up and the feelings were mutual.They all still had connections to the old neighborhood that they grew up in, in more ways than one would think.  The boys had been successful in both athletics in high school being able to further on their education by going to Ivy League Schools. Sean was now a successful Trauma Specialist and ER Doctor.  Eamon of course with hockey.  Sukie was being talked about as well now because she had ""cancer"" and that was something everyone whispered about behind her back and looked at her differently.  Which she hated, she wanted people to just treat her like they did before.  While Eamon had wanted to rush back and help when he heard the news earlier, he waited but he did vow to treat her normally.  But he didn't know just what he was getting himself into.Practice makes you perfect is something that we have all heard, well Sukie felt she was out of practice in bed and needed someone to help her, that person was Eamon on the condition no strings attached.  Little did they realize that there were strings and the heat they created with each other was enough to melt the ice rink that Eamon played on. An accident on the ice made them realize how much they did need each other.It was a good short story and did remind us that if you do know someone who has been affected by an illness they do want to be treated normally.  I do hope that the author comes back with a story on Sean because he sounds like an interesting man himself.","01 8, 2012",A2SH5G781HK3YV,M. Bass,Will the ice help cool down this romance?,1325980800

When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5","12 19, 2008",A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""",Steadily getting better!,1229644800

I am sick of writers making it look like a man only sleeps with women for a need to be fulfilled. That is not true. Yes, they can keep out the emotional attachments but they still get excited over the woman they are with (they kind of have to). I hate thinking that another woman can so easily take the place of the heroines in these stories. Who cares that there is not emotion in the hero's couplings, he still thinks about how many women he went through and how they dressed sexily when the heroine was wearing comfortable clothes, and let us not forget the thought of how his past women were willing to do explicit things to him!! That was gross and unneeded for the story! I actually started out liking him in the first chapter before it skipped ahead 8 years and to a completely different guy and a douchebag to boot!

It didn't make any difference that he was a rich, handsome sex god because his character was hard to take. Charlie was an innocent 18 year old who was quickly falling for him. She had lied to Riccardo and said she was 24, so he had no problem taking her virtue. Riccardo leaves his vineyard where he and Charlie were involved for a few weeks. He never told her that he was actually the owner of the place and when he leaves on the pretense of visiting his mother Charlie follows. At this point, she doesn't know she's pregnant with his child but when she arrives at his mothers palatial home both Riccardo and his mother treat her like trash, and she leaves. 8 years later she has to show a large estate to a client and guess who? It's Riccardo and she takes one look and passes out. That was disappointing because for someone who's been playing the radio loudly in the car for the last eight years of her life to block out the memories of Riccardo you would think she would have been thinking what she would do if she ever ran into him again. So she wakes up and yes she tortures the hell out of him but not nearly enough for the pain, he and his mother cost her. However, even with her having somewhat of a back bone and Riccardo being a block head the story and the book were extremely good and just to see Riccardo eat crow at the end was worth the price of the book.

Somehow, they are produced, written and made; but in so many cases, you end up wondering...what were they thinking?In this case, the author seems to have stitched together a ponderous book with a plot line that simply makes no sense. Earth's ozone layer has failed, evidently causing a caste system in which some unspecified ""elite"" end up in domes, and the rest of humanity ends up...not in domes, evidently too stupid to stay indoors. To try to make this all plausible, the author creates a new kind of radiation: One that apparently deteriorates concrete, steel and brick so that it crumbles. Not the domes, of course: somehow, THOSE materials are impermeable.Scratching your head yet? How about these little gems:--The futuristic military is ultra-smart, ultra-mechanized, and ultra-equipped...except when they have to go somewhere in the dark. Then, they fumble and stumble around because in this universe, night vision goggles were never invented.--The outside-the-dome citizens are emaciated, radiation-ravaged and prone to bleeding and dying at a moment's notice...except when the citizens are related to the main character. Then, they perform superhuman feats over several days with various injuries and little food with no apparent problems.--In a world where all the land is described as arid, lifeless and barren, half the characters drown their sorrows with a good cigarette. Which is made of tobacco. Which is grown...where exactly?--The author has decided that virtually every noun deserves an adjective and every verb deserves an adverb. Glass never breaks - it breaks softly. Honestly. No one ever stares - they universally stare coldly or hotly, and both words are apparently interchangeable to the author. I daresay there are 3,000 completely superfluous words in this novel attributable to useless adjectives and adverbs.Indeed, there are whole passages that are redundant and serve to do nothing to advance the story. In this universe, military men conduct 20-minute long conversations to debate the pros and cons of helping a stranded soldier in the middle of an epic battle, and the dialogue is incessant in its repetition.Even with an editor and a halving of the story (and believe me, it would be easy to cut this novel in half), there is simply no character development that makes you want to root for the hero or his family. Oh...and the sequel? It contains virtually no ties or links to the initial story.All in all, this is one hot mess of a book.

2840,B001NPDA44,"[0, 0]",4,"I initially bought the official K2 leather cover, and it was generally fine.  But I eventually decided that I'd like a cover/case that completely encloses and cushions the Kindle, as I tend to carry it around a lot, toss it in the car during trips, etc.  So I bought the Belkin Neoprene Sleeve Case after seeing and reading about it on Amazon.  And, happily, it turned out to be a great purchase, handsome and functional.  I especially like the way the cushioning inside isolates the Kindle from the zipper, so there's no danger (unless you're really, really careless, or maybe drunk) of scratching your Kindle while zipping or unzipping the case.And even though this is a soft product, there's just enough stiffness to the Belkin Case to prevent the material from settling down and sitting on the Kindle screen when you place the covered device down somewhere.  Though there's really no harm if that does occur, as the Kindle sits snugly in the case and won't move around and create friction between the inside surface and the screen.So, yeah, this is a very nice product, and it's economically priced, to boot.  Why not five stars, then?  Well, unlike the stiff official K2 cover, this is still a soft case that won't allow you to safely place anything of weight on top of it, so the Kindle will always have to be on top of any pile of things you're carrying or placing in a carry-all bag.  And I always have to take the extra, perhaps slightly inconvenient, step of making sure my grip is pressuring the keyboard area, not the more sensitive screen area, when I'm carrying the case around.  But these are quibbles.  There's yet to be a Kindle case or cover that perfectly addresses all concerns, and maybe it's not realistic to expect one.So, for now, if you're looking for a cushioned case that completely protects the Kindle from weather, scratches, minor bumps, and other things along these lines, you can't go wrong with the Belkin Case.","03 18, 2009",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

2849,B001NPDA44,"[9, 9]",5,"BELKIN NEOPRENE KINDLE 2 CASEI just purchased a Kindle 2 after my Kindle 1 died, perhaps partially because of the fact it slipped out of its Amazon case (poorly designed in my opinion) and fell a few times, hitting the floor or my desk fairly hard. The Amazon case also did not protect it completely when I was traveling and it was not in use. Since my wife already had a Kindle 2, I was aware that Amazon had provided metal hooks to secure that model in its case, and that the thinner design made it easier to read in the case as well. However, I wanted something to protect my Kindle to the maximum extent possible possible when I was traveling, especially on the train to and from work or when on a plane, rather than just slipping it into a pocket of my briefcase or computer bag and having it fall out by accident when they were open.After reading the reviews, I decided to buy this Belkin case despite my concern that the Kindle had to be removed from the case to read it and it did not fit in the case with the Amazon cover on it. However, I am DELIGHTED with this product. It is exactly what I expected after reading the description and reviews. The Kindle easily fits in it, and because it only zippers across the top and one side the Kindle will not slip out when you open it. Both front and back are well padded, so you don't have to worry how you insert your Kindle, the screen will be protected. and the Kindle 2 is so thin and the case so soft and flexible that it easily slips into a corner of my briefcase, there is no noticeable bulk at all. The only complaint I will echo is that the zippers could have been more heavy duty, although I have had no problems with them.I also bought the Amazon case, expecting to use it when I was reading the Kindle at home or uninterruptedly for a long period of time while traveling, but have found that the design of the Kindle 2 makes it very comfortable to simply read it without a case, especially since the back cover can not slip off as it frequently did with my Kindle 1.Finally, the neoprene smell of which some reviewers complained has been non-existent. either Belkin has modified the product in some manner or I have been very fortunate, but from the time I unwrapped it there has been no odor at at. And I am very sensitive to all strong smells, being severely allergic and sensitive to many odors and often sneezing uncontrollably when initially exposed to them.So, if you carry your Kindle when you travel and want to conveniently protect it when it is not in use whether on the road or at home, I highly recommend this case.If problems develop with this product or it is less durable than it appears, I will edit this review to indicate any problems which arise which would cause me to lower my five star rating.Tucker Andersen","12 12, 2009",AVGGEAI1YGSAP,Tucker Andersen,PROTECTS YOUR KINDLE 2 VERY WELL,1260576000
2850,B001NPDA44,"[3, 3]",4,"For bargain Kindle shoppers this 2nd generation Belkin case may be your only bet as none of the cases or sleeves are cheap for the latest generation.  I, for one, didn't feel like spending half of what the Kindle itself cost on a mere foam square, so I went ahead and tried my luck with this.  Here's what I found.The first thing to note is that my only real need for a case was to keep my Kindle from getting damaged.  Form-fitting and trendy looks weren't really important to me as long as my Kindle was kept safe.  With that state of mind, this case does a fine job.  There is a clear inch or more on all sides, so it WILL move around which is a little annoying.  I'll be honest, it moves around a little more than I had hoped.  Nothing will be damaged because it's all soft n' squishy in there, but still, when I'm carrying it around I don't like it sloshing back and forth.  The most annoying thing though is that the Kindle 3 is much skinnier than the 2nd gen. so there's also a goodly amount of open space in the girth of the case.  What this means is that it will move around side to side, back and forth, up and down, against every wall of the case.  Again, no damage will occur, and it will do an absolutely fine job at keeping the Kindle 3 safe, but it is a bit irksome.  Not enough that I want to spend the 25+ on the correct case, but if I had more money to spare I probably would.~THE GOOD THING ABOUT EXTRA ROOM~As other reviewers have noted, that extra wiggle room can actually be a blessing.  Form-fitting cases don't usually allow any extra space for storing earbuds or usb memory or whatever other tiny gadget you may want to keep with your Kindle.  With this 2nd generation case, there's more than enough room to toss in an earbud or two without any problem, and doing so may actually keep your Kindle more stationary in there.~Also~I bought mine used, obviously, but fortunately my seller was offering the product brand new, which meant it came with a thin removable Kindle-sized foam shipping pad inside the case.  This padding was meant to be removed after purchase, but if you are using a Kindle 3 I actually think it might be a good idea to hang on to it.  The extra padding drastically reduces the amount of open space and actually makes the Kindle 3 fit almost perfectly girth-wise.  Side-to-side there will still be loose room, but with the Kindle fitting more snugly it will barely move around at all.All in all, I'm very happy.  I have an AMAZING e-reader that will now avoid damage as I carry it to and fro.","05 3, 2011",AY6A8KPYCE6B0,Tyson,WORKS FOR KINDLE 3!,1304380800

Ms. Brunkhorst provides the reader with a love story so real, you feel as though you are a part of the drama. The  key setting is in Montana, Big Sky country in all of its majesty.  I related to the small town feel after spending two summers in Missoula, Montana.  Her main character, Chelesa also spent a week in Montana and hence the beginning her a romance with her husband. They make a loving and beautiful family. I loved all of the characters. Ms. Brunkhorst invents them as if she were a supreme being molding and shaping them. Her rich vocabulary and smooth writing style draws in a reader who enjoys utilizing their critical and logical thinking skills. Torn touches all five senses. The love scene may leave you breathless and it did me. Jake, Chelsea's kind-hearted husband is almost a perfect human being. Tyler Benson is awesome in mind, body and soul. Ms. Brunkhorst's secondary characters are as important as the main characters because of their reactions to the events as the story unfolds. These incidents captivate and shake up situations, making the rising action so meaningful. I love the manner in which Ms. Burkhorst inserts drama on top of drama but with flair and lacking confusion and many surprises that touch everyone in Torn in a powerful way. Torn's great ending placed a smile on my face and an indelible mark on my heart. Ms. Burkhorst is a writer to watch and I am a new fan.

He is in the tabloid marriage of the century but he is also unhappy and desperately want kids that his showbiz wife want give him. Now do you know him? His co-star got the part on a fluke, she is happily married to her husband of 10yrs, but as the story unfolds there are hidden issues that will be brought to the light that can no longer be ignored as their marriage unravels. One is the desire to have more children, she wants more he doesn't. How do we get to a HEA, is it possible?If you hate cheating or marriage infidelity you will not like this book. Ty and Chelsea are married to other people when they get together. Chelsea had a good marriage to a good man, they have 2 little girls that they both love, how can she risk it all for what many would call a pipe dream. And Ty although he is at the end of his marriage how could he let his guard down to get involved with a married woman. At times their romance was sweet but it was also extremely selfish. Chelsea's husband Jake had his faults, how he dealt with being the cuckold husband was hilarious at times and also bittersweet. When Chelsea was trying to explain to Jake why Ty is her soul mate he was thinking....""He was going to run screaming like a woman from the ambulance, and probably choke a biotch on his way out."" The author has a talent for making the reader feel two opposing emotions at the same time. Your heart is breaking because a marriage is ending but on the flip side it had its funny moments. The supporting cast of characters helped move this story along and gave it depth. The old adage..less is more..applies to the sex scenes. The sex is hot but it does not take center stage, the emphasis is on the relationships that are formed.Relationships can be messy, this book dealt with a messy subject, you will either love or hate Chelsea and Ty, they are far from perfect. There were moments I hated both of them and pitied Jake, but in the end I really liked them all.

It's delivered a bit after 12:00 AM Monday as opposed to print, which gets here when my local post office feels like it, which is quite variable.Better still, I find myself reading much more content per issue than ever. Undoubtedly, some of this reflects font adjustment. But as I pointed out in my review of The Economist, it may also have something to do with the nature of the Kindle edition. Everything is presented in bite-sized nuggets and I'm not distracted by having too many thing to look at.I'm aware there are things in print that don't appear in Kindle. That's OK. I can live without access to extra content I most often wound up not having read anyway.* * * * * *Later on, as part of some price increase, The New Yorker and Amazon arranged that as long as I kept my subscription, I'd have all access, which includes iPad. It worked fine (although  the Apple app is kind-of mediocre -- you can't adjust font). Then, just the other night, I was booted off and couldn't log back in.I called the New Yorker and they, essentially, told me to get lost and call Amazon. I called Amazon, which confirmed I should have been still getting iPad access, but on further investigation, it seems The new Yorker reneged and switched off these arrangements.Wonderful company, huh. What a bunch of mean-spirited dimwits! I can still keep reading on paperwhite, which is quite comfortable on the eyes and easy to handle. But now, I'm no longer allowed to see all the advertisements The New Yorker sells and prices on the basis of viewership!!!!!! Way to go folks. You really got me. And then, like all other print publications, they cry and whine when revenue falls and blame the internet. Yeah, right!As to the New Yorker on Kindle, it is as it was at the time of my first review. But you do have to be aware that if you subscribe, you are dealing with one of the most miserably mean-spirited customer-hating organizations on the planet. I'm keeping my subscription for now because I still have what I had at the time of my five-star review.

2873,B001O5CHQU,"[1, 1]",4,"Plot/Storyline: 4 1/2 StarsAfter a short prologue, the book opened with a scene from a family's life near Christmas.  After a little introduction, the father jumps into a tale about Saint Nick, who was the origin of the legend of Santa Claus.Saint Nick's story was an interesting mix of fantasy and history. His life seemed to mirror much of that of Jesus Christ (so, Christians be forewarned if this sort of thing disturbs you). Obviously, plenty of research went into the writing of this novel, for which the author is to be applauded. I wasn't really able to get into the Santa Claus as a healer thing, but it did make for an interesting read. For those who were wondering, yes, there are explanations for elves and reindeer, too.One drawback was that I found it very difficult to imagine a man telling the more gruesome parts of the story to children. Initially, the children listening to the story were very young girls, preschool age, I think. The audience later switched to some prepubescent boys; however, I still felt some parts were too graphic even for that age group.The story did drag a little in the middle. I really enjoyed the intervals with the modern day family Christmas. There was a story of a father and a Christmas Tree that had me laughing out loud. Those little intervals were sparse, and more of them might have spiced up the storyline somewhat. At the very least, a little humor interspersed would have given the book a more upbeat feeling.This was not a novel that would ever become part of my Christmas Traditions. It was just way too depressing, even though, oddly, at the same time it offered a wonderful explanation for the traditions of Christmas that involve Santa Claus.Characters: 4 1/2 StarsAlthough the story was all about Saint Nick, he was not very well developed insofar as the reader was not privvy to enough of his thoughts. I wanted to know what he was really thinking when he found he was able to heal. He just seemed to take it for granted. Now, I can understand that after awhile, but the first time had to be exciting or induce some kind of emotion. I think in the mirroring of the life of Christ, the author presented the story in much the same way, as a bystander, but it would have been far more interesting, since it was fictional, to have been given more insight.Writing Style: 4 1/2 StarsThe writing style was excellent for many portions of the story. Even though I felt the novel lagged in some areas, in others, the writing in other scenes felt very rushed, to the point where I had to read sections twice to catch everything. The descriptions were vivid and picturesque. The dialogue was pretty good, but I felt a better job could have been done with the accents or vocabulary to give more a feel for the time period.","01 23, 2011",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,"4 1/2 Stars from ""Red Adept Reviews""",1295740800

For awhile I wondered why even bother to intersperse these stories with the historical fiction.  The last chapter helped to make sense of it.The St. Nicholas part of the story was entertaining, enlightening, and inspiring.

Problem was that one of his student was an unstable teen who probably would need a psychiatric help and instead his family didn't take with the right seriousness the problem. Riley, the student, approached Lucas and when the man refused him, all went to hell: Lucas was raped and left for dead in a burning cabin. He managed to survive and to denounce Riley, but he also lost his life and his lover, who couldn't suffer his scarred body.Now Lucas has a new life in a little small town where everyone loves him, above all the local sheriff; Nicholas is an handsome man, with plenty of choice if he wants, but he sets his eyes on Lucas. When they met five years before, Lucas was still too traumatized by his past events and he was not ready for something serious, and so Nicholas accepted the second choice to be his best friend. But now Riley is out of prison and both Lucas than Nicholas know that the man will come for Lucas, and Nicholas is not willing to let the man take the most important thing he has, Lucas; since Nicholas has no doubt that Lucas is his own.The story is not very long and there is not mystery, since it's clear since the beginning that Riley will try to harm Lucas once again. It's more interesting to read and see how Nicholas will convince Lucas to accept not only his help but also his love. Truth be told, I think that Nicholas takes advantage of the situation to force Lucas to accept something than in other condition it will be years before they arrive to the same point. Probably Nicholas is tired to wait (but not enough to renounce) and above all he is tired to be judge by someone else actions. And this is maybe the point that I understood less: it's true that Lucas is scarred, but only on his back; in his everyday life, with dress on, he is a very beautiful man, and no one can notice his scars. All right, being a gay man, maybe having is back all scarred is a bit more important than a straight man (naughty Elisa, I know), but is it enough of a reason to dump someone? Lucas is clever, handsome, with a good work, is it possible that someone dumped him for some scars? And even if it happened, is it possible that he chose 10 years of chastity upon the action of only one man?Anyway, the story is quite tender and the sex is good, something I noticed in the previous books by the same author: she mixes well the two elements, never letting the sex take the main role in the story, always letting the tenderness and love being in first line.","02 10, 2009",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Loving Lucas by Lisa Marie Davis,1234224000

If you have not already done so I suggest you read the prequel of the series called Whispering Lake. These first two books can be read as standalones though. I was hoping to see Cole's story, knowing that he kind of got left holding the bag in the prequel. So a quick recap, Cole is out and about in his wolf form when he stumbles upon Marin an injured battered woman. He calls for help from Cassie (Whispering Lake). Turns out Marin is a mate to one of the super hot brothers (in age order Gabriel, Cole, and Michael; the latter two are twins with different color eyes). Turns out Marin has been abused but is strangely comforted by Cole who adorably stays in wolf form to make her feel more comfortable.This book was given to me for an honest review.First, I want to say that I really appreciated the blending of the prequel with Moonlight Protector it was flawless. Second, the title is aptly named. Cole the lead male in this story is the protector in both human and wolf form. Cole purposely keeps to his wolf form for the comfort of the lead female character Marin who has been kidnapped and abused. Third, the humorous element to this story helps cut the serious nature of the topic. I really felt that the comic relief was pulled off nicely. My favorite scene is when the dirt bag who kidnapped her appears at the family's Victorian home asking for Marin; Cole and Marin come out of his room all over each other pretending that they have been up to no good, while Michael the constant jokester plays with the whole charade in order to protect Marin (the scene is a lot funnier than my lame attempt and summarization).I really enjoyed the twist that if you are a mate then your packs blood can heal you, I found this fascinating from an anthropology standpoint. I wondered if evolution specifically selected for something like that (just an errant thought). There was a great blend of drama, romance, paranormal, and mystery. Once again Mrs. Coulter Smith has transported me into Ashton Grove, Georgia and made me lose track of time. I was so absorbed in the story I missed Lunch!

He and his two brothers live in the large Victorian home that had belonged to their parents. He's always wanted to find his mate and start a family. Now that he's in his thirties, he's starting to give up hope.

I feel compelled to at least write a short review because the story has not left my head even though I finished it a few days ago. Judgment is about domination and submission with a fairly violent spanking bent. Don't get it 'twisted' though, we're not talking about sweet over-the-knee erotic spankings. The action is somewhat extreme but without permanent injury. There's a bondage emphasis as well.Judgment is a non-consensual capture story about the dominant Mountain Lord and the young woman/captive he takes a particular interest in... who he names Mischief. The Mountain Lord, Daymon Tane, is a slaver and Mischief is originally abducted with other women. The setting is then the mountain fortress where Tane and his cohorts train submissives for sale. I'm not interested in multiple captive stories unless it is personal and important between a particular couple, which is how things develop here. It is definitely a story about Tane and Mischief and, even though I know it's wrong, I like them together. The secondary characters (mostly the other dominants/masters) and the world building make the story very interesting as well and help to move the action along. And there's also the aspect of Mischief, after becoming the perfect submissive object, interacting with the outside world.Two other things to say. If you liked stories like Kitty Thomas'Comfort Food, Stephanie Snow'sDemon's Captiveor Remittance Girl'sGaijin(all of which I recommend), you will definitely like this. Also, it turns out this book existed in another incarnation...asJudgement(notice the now absent E). From what I can tell, this was with a former publisher, BUT, if you go to that link, you can read a few other positive reviews.OK, I said my peace.

2895,B001Q3KT1K,"[0, 0]",5,"I can only guess that this book has attracted readers (see goodread reviews) because of the cursed FSOG and those readers couldn't actually handle the content...... again like other books I have read as dark as this, why can't the reader throw away their subjective when reading these dark books?  It's almost as though I feel they can't go public and admit to liking such a 'mess with your head' book.  It's not as if the author doesn't warn of the content, and it's that warning that actually totally drew me to reading this book and I wish potential readers would heed these warning before embarking on taking a book like this on.Heck no I could never see myself wanting to be anyway near these kinds of situations but I cannot applaud authors enough that deliver such a depravity filled environment so powerfully.  It's the shock factor, the scene building, the pain filled scenes, the humiliation and the sheer desperation that drip off the pages that the author must be undeniably congratulated for.  I can only imagine the talent it must take to pull a book like this off and do it so well.So, if we're going to liken this book to others I say shame on you for those that read it because of FSOG!  God this isn't even in that field, FSOG is a ballet version of BDSM, Judgment is a Rottweiler version of BDSM, it's captivity, mind manipulation, coercion, force, rape and total submission and mostly draws on the 'S' element of BDSM.  So the books I would put this in line with are, Captive in the Dark, Seduced in the Dark, The Tied Man, Undeniable for the shock factor, Underestimated for the captivity and treatment, Wanderlust for the dominance of the main character - these are to name but a few.So a brief take on the characters, oh my squirming behind, those masters!  Hateful, hurtful and totally magnetic, same goes for Tane, the Mountain Lord, this guy is one of the darkest male leads I have ever come across but I couldn't help but be mesmerised by him.  Yes the inner part of me wants him to suddenly realise what a complete A-hole he is but again he's penned in such a way that you're drawn to him in a weird way, it's almost like being compelled.Callie aka Mischief, I love that girl, my heart bled for her and my stamina routed for her.  I wanted her rebel like she was, I wanted her to be able to show them she could take everything they threw at her and remain true to herself but of course they just upped their game, total dominance is required and I felt each time a little chink of her was stolen from her.I also loved that although this is one of the darkest books I've ever read it also had its lightness, for instance (she had to remain facing the wall):-*** The door opened and I quickly snapped around to face the wall again. From behind me, a low voice drawled, ""Was that movement I just saw?""With a hint of amusement, one of the guards replied, ""To be fair, she did glance at the wall once or twice.""""That's what I thought."" ***So if you can handle truly dark erotica, not a single flower in sight, only the devil in many forms that you will like this book and if like me you appreciate the building of the book and its deliverance then you'll love it like me.  I can't wait to read Mercy and see what that has in store.","09 3, 2013",A14Z3HHQ6JGJA2,An avid reader.,Darkness and Depravity......... truly not for the faint hearted,1378166400

2901,B001Q3KT1K,"[1, 1]",4,"This book jumps right in and grabs you from the first page and I just about read it in one sitting. It is a gripping story about sex slavery, focusing on Callie, aka Mischief, a young girl kidnapped while vacationg in Europe. The tale is told by her, first in her current situation where she is being held by the police who are trying to figure out who she is and what is wrong with her; and secondly about her time in the facility called Judgment.I do not normally enjoy flashbacks in my books, but they are present throughout this one, and I found them to be short and extremely important to the rest of the story. Mischief has undergone extreme conditioning, over the span of ten + years, which explains her behavior with the detectives. The rest of the book is spent describing her experiences at Judgment, which consisted of many colorfully described beatings with just about every implement available by just about every Master in the place (and there are quite a few).There is some sex here and there, and even a quick f/f scene, but it isn't focused on or described nearly as much as the overall behavior modification and the techniques the Masters employ to produce ""finished products"" for sale. The girls move up through several rankings, the ""luckier"" ones become Personals (personal slaves to the Masters).I loved this story (something maybe wrong with that, I don't know), but I just couldn't put it down until I knew how things turned out one way or the other.

2907,B001Q3KT1K,"[1, 1]",3,"Judgment was a really strange and different read for me.The system in Judgment was somewhat more difficult to understand. First off, the slaves were all women, and all came into the system non-consensually. The book was told by female Mischief, an American woman kidnapped from an airport by human traffickers.The society is set-up as a hierarchy in a ""school"" (if you will) of 200 female slaves, and the guards and ""headmasters"" who oversee them, and an ""overlord"" who runs the full operation (the quoted terms are my own, not necessarily as written in the book, btw).The women are subjected to tortuous stuff and poor living conditions to break their wills and force them to participate in this society, and eventually they behave so they can move up to the next level of slavery, which has different duties and different privileges, with the ultimate goal of being sold to a kind master or of becoming a personal slave and pampered companion to a ""Headmaster"" or the ""overlord."" Our protagonist, the unusually flame-haired Mischief, skips the rank nonsense and basically moves from 'newbie' to 'overlord's beloved pet' in a short period of time, but that's pretty typical of this kind of story, so I'm not knocking it.The real fascination with this story is that Mischief accompanies her Master to the US and gets separated from him, freaks out, and gets picked up by the police.She no longer is emotionally capable of feeding or dressing herself, and has no comprehension of the real world.The narrative flips between the now-Mischief in the hands of the police, and the then-Mischief when she was a newly captured slave.The level of her Stockholm Syndrome is extreme and shocking. That's pretty much all I'm going to say about that.Judgment is what I would call ""erotic fantasy"" - nothing you'd ever want to live, but interesting if you like reading about alter-society systemic sexual slavery, rough sex, torturous beatings, and a brainwashed protagonist with Stockholm Syndrom. It has all this, and good writing, to boot.There's a lot of time spent on Mischief's capture and the first few weeks in the system, before she settles into her role, then it's a lightening move into the present, and the transition was a little too quick for me. I would have like to have been privvy to more of the conflict that made her dear to her Master, and maybe even a little glimpse into a sex scene that she actually enjoys...","12 23, 2012",A1Z19RR9KNVIOH,Sheri Johnson,Systemic slavery,1356220800
2908,B001Q3KT1K,"[1, 1]",4,"While I was reading this, I wavered between a 3 and 4 star rating and it wasn't until I had completely finished that I felt that this was a solid 4 star read. I think this is probably marketed as dark erotica but, while it is dark with a big ole capital D, it's not very erotic. The sex, when it is described, is perfunctory, without soul and not at all sensual and certainly not erotic.There's a whole heck of a lot of non-con going on in this book so, if non-con in fiction is a hard limit for you, I probably wouldn't pick this one up. Also, my review is likely to be spoilery so if you read on, you have been warned. This is book is quite fantastical so be prepared to suspend your disbelief to enjoy the story.We start with Callie/Mischief in the hands of the police. She's been separated accidentally from her Master and is being questioned by the detectives about who she is, why she is dressed the way she is and who put the vicious red welts on her arse. She is beyond terrified, totally unable to do anything for herself and desperate to be returned to her Master.Every chapter starts this way with Callie with the detectives and then returns to the story of her initial abduction and torture. Callie is abducted from a European airport and sold by gypsies to Judgment - an institution which deals in female sex slaves. The girls are rounded up stripped of their clothes, their freedom, their choice and their dignity. They are subjected to the most appalling beatings and torture and rape in order to bring them to heel.Calllie is a particularly rebellious Slave and things do not go well for her but she catches the eye of the top Master and he decides he wants her for himself. There is a strong hierarchy among the slaves and they can rise to the position of `Personal', a coveted slave by a Master or, if they are too disobedient, sold off to the highest bidder. Callie suffers horrific beatings with her body being forced into agonising positions to maximise her pain. She constantly rebels but there is a pivotal moment in the story when you realise she has reached the point of no return. She has been completely broken but has risen to the coveted rank of Personal.Back with the detectives, it is apparent that Callie/Mischief has absolutely no capacity to function normally in the real world - she can do nothing for herself and craves only a return to her Master. What lies ahead for her in the real world is being committed, psychiatric incarceration and drug therapy. She would be essentially swapping one form of captivity for another. This is the crux of the book and the moment that the book absolutely earns its 4 star rating because I found myself wanting her to return to the brutal captivity under her Master. Despite the horror and revulsion I'd felt while reading the story of her submission, I really felt that she was better off back with him and it's this mindmelding that makes the story work for me. She may be returning to agonising beatings but at least she understands her place, understands what is expected of her and feels `at home'. She's too far gone to be able to function in the normal world and her only hope for the future is with her cruel Master who in his own way probably does love her.In this respect, this is fairly similar to Comfort Food but the similarity ends there. Comfort Food feels isolated and fairly sensual but this is a mass organisation and it didn't feel at all erotic to me.There is a sequel and I will probably read that eventually as the issues a long term sex slave faces are brushed over very rapidly despite being fairly major events and will probably get more page time in a sequel.","06 1, 2013",AHDWNMKWFS4FZ,Sinfully Sexy Book Reviews,Very Dark,1370044800
2909,B001Q3KT1K,"[3, 3]",4,"Rating:  4.5 starsThis book was a dark read and it is not anything like FSOG--it's about Master/slave and about a Dom/sub.  The story takes place at Judgment-a secluded fortress type mansion that holds hundreds of women captive and who will be sold into slavery. Callie first given the name Red because of her hair and later renamed Mischief by her Master was kidnapped and brought to Judgment. When Mischief arrives at the compound she fights her captives and pays the price. Her defiance earns her attention from Tane-the head Master-on her first night at Judgment. Her defiance continues as does his fascination with her.Her defiance continues and that is what earns her the name Mischief. She is eventually broken when she tries to escape and lands in the arms of Tane. He sentences her to a caning and waiting she does something that earns her a total of 30 strikes of the cane.While we are learning about how Mischief was captured and tortured into complete submission the author also dives into the physiological state of Mischief. There are other interesting aspects to this story.  There is a whole hierarchy of slaves-the top being Personals.When presented with a real chance of escape I was shocked at her response-which really just goes to show you how beaten down and broken she really became.  Overall, there are some twists and turns in this story and there is ALOT of violence and some steamy scenes.

I also struggle in general with age play - why would an adult think having sex with a child is a good thing?

He is again competing at a national level and again he has as an assistant Josh. Josh is a young chef who looks with starry eyes upon Peter: for Josh everything Peter creates is perfect, and when Peter loses, for Josh is almost a personal matter. Obviously Josh is in love with Peter but he has never had the courage to make a move on Peter, both since he doesn't judge himself worthy of the love of wonderguy Peter, and because he really doesn't know if Peter is gay, since the man never express an interest in him, other than for work.But this time Peter seems a bit more interested in Josh as a man than in Josh as a pastry assistant...The story is short, less than 40 pages, but really really sweet. I like above all the fact that Peter is really not a special guy, maybe he is even a bit overweight, and he is really a sweet guy; but for the loving eyes of Josh he is wonderful.","04 5, 2009",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Peanut Butter Kisses by Pepper Espinoza,1238889600

""The Black Phone"" is one of the stories in Hill's book 20th Century Ghosts. [Note: the Amazon book description is for four different stories; only the last description that begins with ""John Finney..."" applies to ""The Black Phone.""]In the story, John Finney has been abducted by a man dubbed by the media as the Galesburg Grabber, a fiend who has already kidnapped and murdered several kids in the area. John found himself alone in a dark, cold basement that held only a toilet and--surprisingly--an old wall-type telephone that wasn't even connected. As John lost hope and despaired of his fate, he heard the old telephone ring. Was it his frightened imagination, or was someone else really on the line?I enjoyed the story very much. The storyline could have led to some explicit nastiness by the villain, but it didn't. After steadily building up tension, the story's climax was a surprise, but in the context of the story, it was a logical ending. To say anything more would be a spoiler.In a surprise twist, the author has hidden a second story, ""Scheherazade's Typewriter,"" in the acknowledgments after ""The Black Phone,"" so you're actually getting two stories with your download. ""Scheherazade's Typewriter"" was a very short but clever story that gave a new meaning to the word ""ghostwriter""!","05 13, 2012",A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,J.

This is the second book of the trilogy.The heroine is a strong-willed girl, who has decided to have her own adventure. This story is exciting, fast-paced, and might have you holding your breath while some of the action takes place. It has all the elements of the first story, but the heroine has much more self-confidence. The description of the shadow world of Kimyra was excellent. I was not ready for the story to end when it did.Rick Just writes because stories are in his head, and need to come out. Good books aimed at teens and young adults can be hard to come by. This story shows the young reader that persistence can overcome the challenges in our lives, even when those challenges seem to be overpowering.I would recommend this story to teens and young adults. It is a very well written, fun to read book.

A quick romp on the kitchen table, lack of foreplay and the failure to utilize a condom or give Lena the option of asking or expecting one left me feeling as though Brenda, not only over looked Lena's true feminine side but lead me to believe that she has the same feelings as Morgan's ex and her desperate cousin Jasmine. She seemed to overlook at times or dispel Lena's feelings about her weight and perhaps even bought into the feeling that there is no way a plus size women should have the right to a man of Morgan's calibur. You would think that after Morgan's pursuit, trickery and lust for Lena that their joining would be earth shattering like that of the passion Brenda vividly bestows upon his brothers throughout each story. However not only did Brenda fail to fully ignite the depths of Lena's passion for Morgan, she failed to bring out Morgan's passion and love for Lena. If a man gets on national television and announces to the world how much he loves a woman, runs the risk of losing his life long dream of become a progressive politician, you would think that he would display that same passion, zeal and respect for the women he put it all on the line for. Brenda denied Morgan if you will (his day, hours in bed with the love of his life)unlike his brothers who were determined to get their leading lady, but were even more determine to make sure she was fully his inside and out of the bedroom.Brenda, may have presented Lena as a Queen Latifah look alike, but her love scenes for the character fell short of giving her the confidence and passion of Queen Latifah. And denied Lena of the earth shattering sexual experience felt by other female characters in this series.All of the men throughout this series ""Forged of Steele"" are refined, well manner, passionate outside of the bedroom, but when they get behind closed doors they become hungry almost animal like for the women they want and love. Morgan's character however only fits this description outside of the bedroom leaving the reading feeling disappointed and cheated in the end.....","08 24, 2011",A1S3BDVA0U96JE,Amazon Customer,Plus size passion,1314144000

Then Vanessa's reason for not trusting Cameron in the last book was weak at best. His job? Also didn't like the ending of Vanessa Steele's story. It went against the character buildup of Cameron being strong and the controller of his world for the story to end with him huddled in a basement waiting for a rescue.  He's a Texan!  I Would have preferred a rescue scene or one where Cameron hid her away then grabbed his shotgun (you don't live on a 10 acre ranch without one) made a cell call to his friends and then went out and took care of business in a Westmorelands/Madarises kind of way.

There were characters named Baider, Paider and Kaider in the novel and that only added to my confusion.The 2 main characters (Who could have been the same guy from all the lack of differentiation in their personalities/descriptions) spent all their time pondering their and their crewmate's relationships while fighting off aliens. Maybe its just me but if I am dodging aliens and running for my life, I am not wondering if one of my crew members is sleeping with the gorgeous doctor on board the ship...and thats another thing...everyone in the book seems to be extremely well built and drop dead handsome or Supermodel material...what, there are no ugly people in the future?One guy seems to start out white then suddenly he's described as African-American and then the book later speaks of his pale complexion....what's that all about? All the women in the book spend their time crying over the smallest incident or completely breaking down and cracking under pressure so that the males in the book feel repeatedly obligated to comfort them, put their arms around them and tell them it will be alright.The locals of the future apparently speak redneck and after reading several chapters of words written like they are spoken as in ""Yuens folks git long now, ain't no cause fer alarm...""

First of all it sometimes felt like it was written by two or more different people; one who writes well, one not so good, and a really bad one whose style is quite juvenile. The knowledge of the science is very good most of the time and some of the writing is sometimes so sophisticated it made me think that this was an experienced writer but then it would go downhill again.There are a number of typos, misspellings, and wrong use of words, for example: their instead of they're, conger (an eel) where the word should have been conjure. One of the major characters from the Mars site named Clapton just disappears about half way through the story after the capture by the aliens - no I don't mean the aliens killed him or something else dire happened to him - the author just forgot him. Also it would seem to me that a nuclear winter lasting 300 or more years would not have resulted in just a colder climate in Oregon but an all out ice age.I know writers (and obviously editors) tend to get lazy due to the use of spell checkers but for goodness sake, USE A GRAMMAR CHECKER as well.Like I said, I would have given 4 stars due to the plot, action, and the interesting take on time travel but . . .","12 10, 2011",A2W92T8XJFO3BN,"Mary D.

At the same time, a few survivors of an alien attack on Mars must make their way back to Earth via capture by the aliens. It was interesting at first but I found many of the characters were easily interchangeable, mainly the leaders of the two groups and the military men on Mars. In fact, one of the latter was so easily overlooked as to stop existing in the middle of the book! He wasn't killed, didn't wander off of the space ship and get lost, no suspended animation or the equivalent; he just stopped existing in the story. Clapton, where are you?The characters also seem to spend a lot of time thinking about the opposite sex even though their lives are all in danger almost constantly. The female who is nominally in charge of the sub when the captain and 3 other members of the crew go ashore, is so worried about the captain (though not the other 3 people) that she sends two more people out into the unknown to find him. And none of the other crew members went, ""Wait. What?""Now the captain phones home and says, ""we're fine but you need to recall those men because there are bands of dangerous people wandering around who could kill them."" This news is passed onto our two wandering rescuers who promptly throw more wood on their fire. If this is the gene pool for humanity, we're in serious trouble.At this point, I don't think I'll finish the book even though I'm 60% through it.

Had that claim not been there, I would have given more slack. For instance, the use of 'to conger' when it should have been 'to conjure' or 'dear hunt' for 'deer hunt' and many more. As for other readers complaining about the female characters being portrayed as weak, etc...well...that is the author's right to describe his characters the way he wants. And those that had complaints about the hill people and their language-it's not an unheard of way of portraying people who have survived disasters. An episode of Star Trek (the original series) had characters butchering the language, and believe it or not, there are hill people alive today that speak in a very similar way, so no complaints there.The switching back and forth between the future and the past or rather present (however you wish to term it) is not hard to follow and actually had me curious as to how it would be resolved.If the author cleans the typos up, and fixes the incorrect tense of some verbs, and cleans up the pronouns I can easily see it as a 4-5 star book, but for now, it's two stars.

Neither of them sees any foreseeable problem with sharing Maddie - especially since her playful demeanor and body's reactions show that she is attracted to both men.What none of them could have guessed is that the attraction between Connor and Maddie is more than just physical.

3018,B001RV3ON6,"[3, 3]",3,"Keith and Abigail are an interesting leading couple. Both are alpha's (this is not typical for many paranormal/werewolf/vampire type books I've read) and strong. A leading lady that is strong but not hard and sarcastic is a welcome change for me. At first I thought Abby very smart - then she makes a choice I did not feel was in character for her and her strength sort of fizzles.I felt that the concept of a guide was good - that a new werewolf needed someone to help him/her control the wolf and learn about the community. Surprisingly that part did not seem rushed to me - I was fine with it. I thought the sex scenes were fine - they don't overwhelm the story nor do they seem contrived just for their own sake.What this book needed is about another 50-100 pages. Its true you hit the ground running but it leaves you with a quizzical bewildered viewpoint that just never really goes away. Too many unanswered questions.It needed backstory as to why the bad guy would turn Abigail, what he stood to gain from it, and why he so desperately seems to want her back. And her own backstory is flimsy - you just don't really feel her at all.Although there is some explanation of the politics of the shifter world it needed to be more in depth - as we are told repeatedly that there are bad alpha's and good alpha's and the good are becoming more and more scarce. I was very intruiged with that storyline and wanted a lot more depth and explanation of it - especially as the Main alpha Gavin didn't seem to have a ton of contact with other ""old school"" alpha's. It seems as if the story is going to devolve into an us vs. them...if so we need to be more connected to the ""us"" so we want to win against the ""them"".The werewolf/witch war also needed a bit of backstory - again another intriguing concept that gets barely a scarce mention and a very brief exposition. It would have been a much stronger book if we would have experienced Keith in combat - as it is we are just told.And that was my main problem with the novel - we are just told too much. It definitely had the feel of a series set up - the elements are all here they just don't fit into the puzzle as nicely as they could have. It has a very superficial feel. Like you are scratching the surface only and there is much below. It needed more fleshing out.However it is a quick read (very quick - all told less than an hour for me) and the characters are likable enough. It has great potential to develop into a wonderful series with more depth. I will be picking the other books up to read on my Kindle.","06 20, 2010",A3TP31S61PPE3G,AlexJouJou,A pretty solid 1st in the series with a few issues,1276992000

It read a little more like a novella than a full on novel as there were parts that seemed thrown together and pieces skimmed over.If you are looking for a little paranormal romance that is solid and reliable, then this is for you. The characters weren't fully developed, but you got the general idea who they were. Part of this was the need to set up a bit of a backdrop for future stories, I think. I found Ms. Rogers depiction of pack rules to be interesting and LOVED the touch that the heroine was a strong wolf, but because of her circumstances didn't know what the heck was going on.It was light, funny and romantic. There were one or two plot points that left our characters making silly decisions and that was a bit annoying. And the sequence of events wasn't exactly surprising- no twists, turns or cliffhangers here. BUT!

3021,B001RV3ON6,"[0, 0]",4,"Dylan Gennaro and Abby Adler are on the run from their violent alpha, Alan Matthews. Alan turned Abby against her will a month ago, and treats women very badly. Although Abby is more of an alpha wolf and Dylan is much more submissive, he knows he needs to get her out of this cruel pack. Near by is Red Rock Sanctuary, a pack led by Gavin and his mate Samantha. They take in runaways from these packs that have violent out of control alphas. They get word Dylan is on his way, but it starts to get late. Gavin sends one of his alpha wolves, Keith to investigate. Keith is an alpha in the pack and has spent years fighting in the wars against the wizards, so he is good in these situations. Keith discovers Abby and Dylan on the side of the road, fighting off a couple of Alan's wolves sent to bring them back. After Keith shoots them all (Did I mention he is lethal?) he escorts them safely to Red Rock.They are welcomed and given a safe place to stay. One of the first rules Gavin has is all new wolves need a Guide, someone to lead new wolves through the first couple of months. Not only teaching them the basics of being a shifter, but the bond usually goes much more intimate than that. At the end of the Guide period, the couple can choose to go their separate ways or sometimes feelings have developed and they stay together to explore their relationship.As soon as Abby and Keith meet, their wolves immediately take notice of each other. Their human sides are also very attracted. Abby has to be the one to choose the Guide, and not forced into the decision. Keith with an overwhelming protectiveness needs Abby to choose him, but being the gentleman he lets her have time to adjust and look over her options. Abby knows he is the one, and when the sexual tension is about ready to burst, she agrees and the first lesson he teaches her is in the bedroom. But the fun ends when Abby gets a picture of her sister, who has been kidnapped by Alan. With Keith's help, they race to save her.Cry Sanctuary is full of alpha male goodness. The moment Keith, or I should say his wolf sees Abby, that is it for him. He goes into growly, overprotective mode. He stalks around, on edge, being a perfect gentlemen towards Abby, but letting everyone know she is off limits. Years ago, he lost a lover, and the raw emotions from that relationship coupled with his alpha status, make for a very intense male. He sees being her Guide as an honor, and the thought of any other male near her makes him almost lose control.Abby also exudes alpha status, and although she is terrified and confused by her new life, she is a tough cookie. She accepts Keith from the beginning. I like that they never refuse or deny their attraction. When they come together, two powerful wolves in the bedroom, it's a smexy overload. Abby feels guilty for having these strong feelings for Keith and for wanting him sexually at the same time as having him for her Guide. It takes prodding from both Keith and some friends to convince her Keith wants the same thing.We also meet the other wolves of Red Rock. Leaders Gavin and Samantha run a tight ship but are very warm. Joe, Keith's friend stays his friend after he realizes Abby is off limits and provides some very sarcastic comments. Abby's friend Dylan, who is more submissive gets a book in this series and I can't wait to see what they do with his character. I sometimes thought all the residents of Red Rock, or at least the ones we meet are a little too perfect. Everyone is so nice and welcoming but you can argue Gavin is a strict alpha and doesn't let anyone get out of line. This book is also on the shorter side so we don't get a lot of background into the war with the wizards but there are several more books to the series and I'm looking forward to reading more about this group. Although there is a satisfying ending, there is much left to explore.Cry Sanctuary is a action filled paranormal romance, with plenty of alpha action to steam up the pages.","04 6, 2010",A1W5WDICY81WQ3,"A.

My issue with the book is the pretense of involving ""werewolves"" at all.  It is really just a book about two people and love.  That's fine and all, but don't try to add an element of fantasy that is simply not there in this book.  It might come later in the series, but I will not read on to find out.  I read the entire book to never actually have a werewolf involved in it but in name alone.I was sorely disappointed with the story-line as a romantic novel, with little to no action.  Had I ordered the book from amazon, and not simply on my kindle, I imagine the cover would have tipped me off, so shame on me. 1 star for being rather well written, 1 star for what I guess might be an engaging romantic novel, but I cannot verify that as its not my genre.

You meet two Alphas that are awesome people and one that sucks. There are plenty of struggles, lust, love, and comradeship to learn to love these well written characters.

There are plenty of paths that this story can take and it will be a great series to continue.The story was definitely well written with great characters that are believable and easy to understand. The only negative I can really say is that there were plenty of instances where the writer kept saying she (Abigail) just doesn't understand this or that, and then offers no explanation. So, I kept reading ""She just doesn't know or understand..."", and I kept thinking no crap - could you explain it?!?

And though the author had some intriguing ideas about werewolf culture, the book had one fatal flaw that I couldn't over look: artificial conflict.I can't stand it when the conflict in a story only comes as a result of the characters making stupid choices and putting themselves in unnecessary danger.  After promising multiple times not to put herself in danger, the heroine does exactly that the very first chance she gets, and willingly gives herself to the bad guys.  Plus, I don't think it was explained well enough about why the heroine was changed in the first place or why the bad guys wanted her so much.And the relationship between the two main characters progressed too quickly and unbelievably for me.  I found myself doing a lot of skimming while reading and ultimately gave up before the end.I gave the book 2 stars for the interesting bits of world building at the beginning.

Standard porn setting that never seems to work out in real life: three best friends, two male and one female, have been living together ever since college, with she believing that he 1 and he 2 just look at her as one of the guys, when in fact both of them want nothing more than to get her into the sack. She lets slip her two-guy fantasy during a drinking game one night, and after some discussion, they decide to go for a no-holds-barred naked weekend, no strings attached, all go back to being friends on Monday. (And the guys can't touch each other. That goes without saying. sigh.) What separates this from the pack is that Carr is willing to at least touch on, if not fully explore, the deeper emotional consequences that such a thing can lead to, even if it is in service of resolving this in the most genre-romance way possible. Not that there's anything wrong with that.That was sarcasm. There IS something wrong with that, very much so, though I'm willing to give Carr props for breaking trail into an area most Kindle porn writers very consciously avoid. I often wonder whether writers don't go there because they've never been involved in a triad, whether the situation is simply too emotionally complex to go into from their perspective, or whether they avoid it simply for the sake of convenience. Being the cynical bastard that I am, I'll tell you I usually land on #3, but that's obviously not the case here. I'm willing, given that Carr's fumbling in the depicting-emotions arena is just as charmingly nave as that of the protagonist of any book entitled &lt;em>[fill in the sexy female first name]'s Time&lt;/em> that aims for any sort of realism, to accept that #1 is far more likely than #2 here. Pro tip: bet you'd get a kick out of the research. (Not directed specifically at Carr, but more generally at authors writing multiple-partner erotica.)I alluded to the other thing that's wrong here. Why in the world is it that the guys can't even accidentally brush up against one another? Here I have a way more cynical interpretation (kind of like the homophobic version of #3 above): I think authors have some sort of crazy idea that if you actually depict a triad of people who love equally, they'll lose the ""gay is bad, mmmkay?"" readership. I grant you, I've never been one to attempt to make money with any of my creative endeavors, and so I'm no expert on the subject... but I have to say, if you do, good riddance.Someday someone will write a triad book along the lines of &lt;em>Tequila Truth&lt;/em> that addresses these issues in a competent, mature manner, treats all the protagonists with the respect they deserve, and which still contains meltingly hot sex. That day, to my knowledge, has not yet arrived. Until then, &lt;em>Tequila Truth&lt;/em> is one of the deeper, more thoughtful shorts on the subject.

At the last game, 6 months ago, the game took a risque turn which titillated Kylie's imaginations. Ever since, she has been taking dangerous risks in the form of sexual experimentation. Risks that have finally spilt over to Colt and Heath when Colt comes home early from work one evening and finds Kylie's date getting too rough in the bedroom and hurting her.  Colt and Heath decide that Kylie needs room to experiment with men that she can trust so they offer her their sexual services for a weekend of no-holds-barred sex for all three of them. Things take a decidedly hot turn from there.Wow! These 3 have been roommates for 7 years and have never crossed that line, but when they do, they go big! Colt and Heath both have Dom tendencies. They definitely take charge in the bedroom which is what Kylie is searching for in her fantasies.

After spending a lifetime under her father's thumb, she wants to be bold and colorful.

The plain,  spinsterish young woman from Massachusetts has come to claim the inheritance left to her by her aunt, but what exactly that inheritance entails is rather vague.  Gardiner's sheriff, Adam Caldwell, wastes no time in setting Rebecca straight:  She is now the new ""Madam"" of the town's only house of ill repute.  Since Rebecca is clearly not Madam material and Adam could really use a wife, the solution seems simple - Adam proposes.  But after years of taking care of her overbearing father Rebecca is in no hurry to tie herself to yet another man who is just looking for someone to cater to his every whim.  So Rebecca decides to try her new life on for size, and assumes the persona of ""Miss Becky"".  There's just one little problem...Miss Becky can't seem to resist the town's  temperamental sheriff, and Adam prefers plain old Rebecca to her flashier alter ego.I'm always singing Shannon Stacey's praises, but I felt kind of neutral about this one.  I found these characters very one dimensional.  Rebecca's lightening fast transformation from nave and virginal to faux-prostitute was really ridiculous, and the running joke about Adam just needing to shoot someone to blow off some steam got old real fast.  The whole story is very reminiscent of those cheesy, campy western movies and television programs that were so popular in the late 60's/early 70's.  I can almost picture the silly costumes and the fake looking scenery!  Wait!  Do I hear the theme music from Bonanza playing in the background?  I just know that Hoss and Little Joe are around her somewhere...While this one wasn't a good ""fit"" for me, there's no denying that the author really does write quite well.  The pacing is good and the dialog is nicely done.  I think the key to enjoying this is to go into it knowing what you're going to get:  a very light, fluffy romance that's historical in name only.While this is a follow-up to another book set in Gardiner, Texas -Taming Eliza Jane, you won't be lost if you don't read them in order.Occasional strong language and some sexual content.","01 4, 2012",A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,"L.

She dumps the boyfriend, packs her bags, grabs a bunch of the classic books she loves - wildly adventurous and swashbuckling romances that never fail to sweep her away from her average life - and heads to San Diego to meet up with her best friend Valerie. Nothing would please her more than to spend a couple of weeks of fun, friendship, and relaxation. And, of course, reading. Lots and lots of reading.When she gets off the plane and hooks up with Valerie, she comes face to face with the ruggedly handsome but perfectly annoying Connor, the best friend and business partner of Val's cousin Raphael. He's everything Cassandra would never go for in a man. Raphael, on the other hand, is just what she's looking for. He's all things swarthy and genteel, and so gorgeous he looks like he just stepped off the cover of one of her beloved bodice rippers. And she's thrilled when Raphael seems to be equally interested in her.In fact, Cassandra would be contentedly planning her HEA with Raphael if it wasn't for the odious Connor. Not only is he rude, he's got boundary issues - the sort that have him waltzing into her room when she's in the bath, then not having the decency to respect her privacy when she gets out. Then he's all with the kissing and sparring, challenging her at every turn, getting her blood up. The fiend.The longer her vacation continues, the more Connor gets under her skin, until she's practically spitting at him every time he shows up...which is all the time. Problem is, all that conflict has Cassandra questioning her own preferences. Could it be that the hero-type she thought she wanted can't hold a candle to the bad boy she can't help but need? Or is Cassandra's HEA destined to never escape the pages of a book?~*~After the past couple of books I've read left me yearning for some romantic comedy, I needed Lavey'sRipping the Bodiceto cleanse my reading palate and lighten my spirits. It was partially successful in that it's a relatively harmless and humorous romance that made me chuckle out loud in a few places, but it didn't appeal quite as much as I was hoping. I can't say the fault lies with the story, exactly. It's just, as I was reading, I realized I'm not a big fan of bodice rippers. That was a problem because I had a hard time relating to the character who seemed to turn nearly every moment of her life into a scene from one.Instead of being amused by the tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated fantasy life of Cassandra, I was overwhelmed by the number of times the book slipped into italics and flounced around with long scenes of purple prose and over-indulgent scenarios. A few here and there with much shorter length would have been sufficient to make the point and keep the pace of the contemporary romance development from floundering. Not to mention that the scenes took page space from the much-needed character definition and plot development. As a result, too much of the book failed to dip beneath surface issues and conflicts and remained two-dimensional.That was a shame, because there really wasn't anything wrong with what was there outside of Cassandra's dream world. The characters were likable, Cassandra was quirky with a hint of snarky steel that I enjoyed, and there was genuine chemistry between Connor and Cassandra from early into the book. I can't ask for too much more than that. But that's exactly what I feel I got...too much more than that.I didn't mind the predictability of the plot. I wasn't expecting any new ground in romance fiction to be laid with the book so the fact that a reader can see the end coming from a fair distance away didn't bother me. The irony is that the parts of the book that went awry for me were the unexpected parts; the dream sequences, if you will, that didn't appeal. By the end of the book it felt like I'd skimmed a good half of its content to avoid the escalating fiction-within-fiction scenes.

A world where angels and vampires not only co-exist, but have an interesting connection. As a Guild Hunter, one of those that hunts rogue vampires down for the angels, Ashwini finds herself suddenly stuck between two vampire factions, and the angel wanting to manipulate them all, in Atlanta. She turns, for help, to Janvier, a vampire himself - who may have his own reasons for assisting her.From the first moment I started this novella I was immediately immersed in the world. I couldn't have stopped reading if there was a fire. Okay. I hope I could have at least paused to get out of the building, but you get the picture.I'm continually amazed by Nalini's ability to create fully realized characters, especially in novellas where the shortened format makes that difficult for a lot of authors. Angels' Pawn is no different. Ashwini is a compelling character from her first moments pounding on a door. I'm completely intrigued by her, and really hope that we get to see more of her in the future.Janvier. Wow. What can I say except I want to meet him. A native from the bayous, with an old world charm, and an, apparently, innate sexiness, he is just fantastic. Watching him play off of Ashwini, lightening the mood and at the same time ratcheting up their relationship throughout everything they were trying to accomplish in Atlanta was truly a joy.I can not wait to read Angels' Blood which focuses on Elena and Raphael, I believe. But I'm really hoping to see more from Janvier and Ashwini in the future. Their storyline was by no means complete - although the main conflict is tied up in the novella - we have lots more to hear about this pair.Nalini's said it, but I'm going to give this warning to those that need an HEA. This is not a typical romance with a bow-tied HEA at the end.It's a fantastic read, a great introduction, and I highly recommend it. If you've not read anything by Nalini Singh, I urge you to run out and buy everything you can by her.

3096,B001TJ1O4W,"[0, 0]",4,"Angels' Pawn is the fantastic introduction to Singh's Guild Hunters series. Quite different in tone than Angels' Blood or Angels' Kiss, the novels that follow it, I actually enjoyed it more.The main characters in Angels' Pawn are the Guild Hunter Ashwini, and the vampire Janvier. (The main characters in the novels of the series are the hunter Elena, and archangel Raphael.) As some reviewers have mentioned, I felt a bit as if I was missing some world building backstory while reading the novella. However I had no problem figuring out what was going on, and it was one of my few complaints about the story.Singh's character development shines here, something particularly impressive given the short length of the book. Ashwini and Janvier are both interesting, well developed characters; they are each far from perfect, but their own resilience and self-acceptance gives them strength and makes them quite likeable. A cast of interesting side characters are also found throughout the story.Although the storyline touches on many of the same dark and violent themes that Angels' Blood and Kiss do, the overall tone is significantly lighter. This is due in large part, I think, to the main characters themselves. Their banter and sense of fun, as well as the kindness seen between them, gives a sense of perspective that the more solemn characters of Angels' Blood lack. Singh makes no attempt to wrap up Ashwini and Janvier's relationship in this story, although the particular ""mission"" is concluded. I think this was an intelligent choice, and far more satisfying than if she had tried to rush them into a happily ever after. Now I can't wait to see what adventure will bring them together next.","07 14, 2010",A23WE2XLY1MROA,Houston,Excellent novella,1279065600

3098,B001TJ1O4W,"[1, 2]",5,"What a great novella and prequel into the new Guild Hunter series.  This is my first time reading anything from Nalini Singh and I really enjoyed this story.  The world that Nalini has built is both innovative and exciting.  Hunters (humans) are employed by the Guild who are essentially angels, to hunt down vampires that go against their contract w/ the angels.  Vampires are ""almost-immortals"" and are sired and indentured by the angels.  Angels are not the angels from the fairy tales of sugar and spice, these angels are cruel and twisted and thrive on the pain of others.  In this novella we follow a hunter named Ashwini who is hired by the powerful angel Nazarach.  Her assignment is to travel down to Atlanta and hunt down a vampire who has been kidnapped by a rival.  To succeed in her mission Ashwini persuades a vampire (Janvier), who has escaped being terminated by her on more than one occasion, to accompany her.  Ashwini and Janvier have great chemistry and seem to make a great team.  There is a lot of sexually charged tension between them.  There is quite a bit of action and suspense packed into this novella.  I look forward to the first book in the series Angel's Blood, due out 3/3/09.I also recommend:Bloodring: A Rogue Mage NovelSuccubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid, Book 3)The Touch of Twilight (Sign of the Zodiac, Book 3)Hotter Than Hell (Hell on Earth, Book 3)In the BloodThe Iron Hunt","02 24, 2009",A12FGRUDIJI1W4,"Kathy E.

The Guild  hunters are human bounty hunters hired by angel masters to retrieve errant vampire servants attempting to skip out on the hundred years of service that is the price angels charge for immortality.Singh has carved out a nice little vignette for this story and she does a really good job of fleshing out her starring pair:  Guild Hunter Ashwini, who is dangerous and a bit on the crazy side, and Ashwini's favorite target, Cajun vamp Janvier who is her ally and not her prey for this hunt. Both these characters were wonderful and the flirtation between the two makes me hope that Singh won't wait too long to give them a full length novel of their own since Angel's pawn is just a tease for the pair and their relationship is left ` to be continued'.  This lack of closure for Ashwini and Janvier gives Angel's Pawn more of an urban fantasy feel than Singh's Psy-Changlings though.I happened to read Angel's Blood first  and I don't want to spoil that for you, but the one comment that I will make is that Angel's Pawn has a different feel than Angel's Blood - Angel's Pawn only hints at the darkness of this new series and the beauty, danger and cruelty that is part of the ancient angels' natures.

Janvier has a very bad habit of getting himself in trouble with the angels and doing a disappearing act which means the guild are called in to track him down. Ash has spent years chasing him across the world and through the bayou only for him to always make his peace with the angel who hired her just before she catches him. For once Ash's job isn't to search for Janvier though and this time she actually needs his help, she has been asked to find a kidnapped vampire but the last thing she wants is to be caught up in the politics between two of the vampires who report to the angel Nazarach. Since Janvier is familiar with all of the vampires involved she is hoping he can smooth the way and help her through the situation in one piece.Angel's Pawn is the shortest of the novellas included in this book and it is also the only one where we don't get to see a full on relationship develop between the two main characters. In spite of that it was a really enjoyable read and I absolutely loved the banter between Ash and Janvier. they have great chemistry and I have high hopes for them hooking up at some point as the series progresses - there is no way they can deny their connection forever! Ash has always been on the sidelines (although she does have a larger role in the 4th book Archangel's Blade) so we don't know a huge amount about her but she has some very interesting abilities that I'm looking forward to learning more about in future books. I don't remember actually being introduced to Janvier in the earlier books, he was mentioned but I don't think we ever saw him, so it was great to get a taste of his character too.

3169,B001UE7D0K,"[5, 5]",5,"This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy. And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was. However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless. Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities. This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: ""A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts. In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column. Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram.""And how does that help me? one would ask. Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words. Visualization is the key word here. Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story. ""One idea is interconnected with many other ideas,"" we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes. It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process. The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways.""...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become. A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw. Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map. This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind."" Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works. I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try. Well, all that has changed. I now find this subject as intriguing as they come. As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals. I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right. And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose. Is it a self-help manual? In a way it is, but it's much more than that. To use a metaphor I'd say that this is a guide of how to use the GPS of your brain to find the destinations you desperately seek, and need.","12 4, 2012",A31R6P1KDBJQDV,Lakis Fourouklas,How to train your brain,1354579200
3170,B001UE7D0K,"[0, 0]",5,"Mind mapping is a very valuable process if you know how to use it. I tried and gave up until I came across this book. This is a useful guide for everyone from students to professionals. It broke things down, was easy to understand, and offered interesting insights not just about mind mapping, but other learning disciplines as well.At the start of the book, mind-mapping is described as being much like our minds making connections. It's the linking of these ideas and the visual aspect of it that led to the process. The process of mind mapping is a bit more involved than regular note-taking, but can be used for a number of projects and as a writer, I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned. Within a few pages, I was already planning to pitch mind mapping as a project management process for my office and now we are working on one using the techniques learned here.Interestingly, the book touched briefly on other techniques to enhance learning such as speed reading. You'd think speed reading is a digression from mind mapping, however, for me, it actually enhanced the concept. The speed reading technique shown works in line with the theory behind mind maps and how our mind process sight quicker than other forms of data.I also realized th at the reasons I gave up mind mapping before was because I didn't practice. Like everything, practice does make perfect and now that I'm feeling more encouraged to try it again, I've been mind-mapping a list of everything I'd like to organize. It's a different thought process I'll admit, but it is worth it to try.","07 25, 2013",A3HPRFI2RUNPHJ,LisaS.,Visually Stimulating note-taking,1374710400

Who doesn't want that?The idea of mind mapping is that it helps you organise ideas. So instead of taking notes line by line, the idea is to place the central theme or keyword in the middle of the page and add more keywords surrounding it, with lines drawn between them to represent their relationships.According to this book (and now I know, it definitely makes sense!), mind mapping makes you more effective because this method is more compatible with the brain. This is because it matches how the brain functions biologically. Mind mapping also engages both halves of your brain at once, making you much more efficient and effective.A key poi nt, and one very important to me personally is that mind mapping is supposed to enhance creativity. As a writer, there are few skills which are more important! I imagine many writers would find mind mapping a very useful way of planning out their work, linking together various ideas, characters and plot points.As the book says, it'll be difficult to break my habit of making linear notes and the mind mapping will take practice. I've only really covered how I personally will find mind mapping useful, but the book covers a wide variety of ways in which it helps people, for example; note taking, brainstorming, collaborative writing, problem resolution and more.So if you're looking for a way to make your planning and note-taking go more smoothly and effectively, then this book is ideal.","03 4, 2011",A2L3ZY42HQY5FL,Lucy Felthouse,An excellent resource,1299196800

This book takes you through step by step processes to create your own and shows you every day applications for them.Allow me to quote from the first paragraph from the book - ""We live in the information age, which means that our problem is less one of obtaining information and more one of retaining and organising all the quantities of information that we are required to ingest-both during our studies and afterwards.""This is so true of my life. I feel that my brain is so cluttered with so many muddled thoughts that I can't easily access things I need and am left feeling confused and disorganised. Mind Maps is a tool that will enable me to use both sides of my brain rather than one; thus enabling my brain to perform 5-10 times more effectively. Show me a person who doesn't want that in their life! It simplifies complicated information by breaking it down into a diagram that delivers the information in a quick glance `map' rather than long laborious lists which are hard to digest.I can see that it would have great uses for students, writers or anyone giving a presentation. I personally am non academic and live on a homestead farm; for me in everyday life I can see several uses for planning my garden and renovation projects and to solve problems that crop up therein. I can also see it would be beneficial to estimate a timescale to these events. At the moment I seem to have list upon list of countless tasks that now seem insurmountable. I plan to sit down with a large sheet of paper and create my own Mind Map this very evening.The book also includes access to free software. One is web-based, so with a quick click of a link, I was able to start using it right away. The other options are nice as well, though you have to download and install them on your computer.

Annie knows she has more in common with her uncle as a proficient hunter than she does with her younger ""urbanized party going sibling who is connected to the ruthless Netmakers drug smugglers.Will struggles for his life through his memories while Annie struggles to move past her efforts to connect with Suzanne.

However the brave female hunter reconsiders her walking away from New York as she ponders hunting two-legged animals to rescue her sister and provide homage to dying Will who also has a nefarious link to the Netmakers.This deep family drama contains two powerful contrasting story lines that ultimately converge.  The cast is fully developed with the three Birds as the key players who come across as genuine; while the support casts enhances understanding of their personalities or the locale of Ontario or Manhattan.

The story comes to live through two intertwined monologues. We follow Will's thoughts while he recovers from a serious plane crash, a near death encounter that has left him comatose in a hospital bed. Will is an engaging storyteller, a bush pilot by trade and a charming alcoholic by fate with many tales of adventure to tell, some a hoot and some distressful to hear. Alternate chapters are narrated by his niece Annie Bird while she sits in vigil by his bedside trying to stimulate him back to the living. She uses the time to recount her adventures in Toronto, Montreal and New York while in search of her lost sister Suzanne.These flashbacks create short stories in their lives, each one a glimpse into the desolate forests that surround James Bay and the all too similar affect the underground fashion world can have on someone not accustom to the rat race of the big cities. Each layer reveals secrets of violence, incompetence, kindness, love and compassion.The novel is hard to get into at first, the story launches quickly into two narratives, each one hard to decipher which character is talking and how the bits of information fit together. I gradually immersed myself into the tale and once settle, let the story run its course. I was drawn in by the vivid description of Canada's vast wilderness and its inhabitants who call it home, the Cree. It was an eye opener realizing the challenges and hardship native people face in big cities where there is a multitude of cultures all trying to survive.

Now, that he was older and wiser, will Judd allow Mandy to slip through his fingers a second time without a fight?Mandy Sullivan refused to associate with risk-takers because her father was one before it finally caused the death of him and her mother.

So, why after all these years did Mandy still want Judd, especially now when he was a skilled bull rider - but how could she not support an emotionally wounded man that had recently lost his beloved mother?

I had to remind myself a few times that this story was written when women had few rights and were at the mercy of the men in their lives, as well as their surroundings. It was extremely rare for a woman to be able to live a self-supporting, independent life in those days, and I would imagine many had few or no close friends.

A side-plot involves the hero becoming an abolitionist which puts him at odds with his pro-slavery uncle. The views expressed by the characters are far from politically correct and one evil character uses the &#34;N&#34; word. Just beware. That aside, the story is about sweet, orphaned Phoebe fighting against being married off to an oaf while she makes friends with the handsome, upstanding hero....the fun is that Miranda (from the first book in the trilogy) is able to provide just the right help at the right time and everyone can tell how it ends of course....!","02 22, 2013",A1H96T4WT6MYQB,"Pam Lennon ""Pam""",Sweet and old fashioned,1361491200

Yes there were a few editing issues with this particular copy, but the product description clearly states that the book is a reproduction of a book published before 1923 and may have occasional imperfections, such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. In light of this proclamation, it amazed my that so many reviewers still took the time to complain about the typos.  They were present but did not in the least distract from the story, at least for me they did not.  Furthermore, I could not in any way tell that this book had been scanned.Phoebe Deane is an orphan who as a child went to live with her half brother, Albert Deane.  Albert is a mild mannered, kindly man who sees only the good in everyone.  He is also a bit of a dolt.  His wife Emmeline is the evil stepmother type from Cinderella.  She works Phoebe to death and never has a kind word for the girl.  She is also crass with very little education.  Truthfully, she is just plain jealous of the beautiful, refined Phoebe.  Hiram Green, a neighbor of the Deanes' wants to marry Phoebe, but she despises the very sight of him!  The hero, Nathaniel, is a lawyer and the nephew of Judge Bristol, one of town's most prominent members.  Nathaniel lives and works in New York City, but often visits with his uncle who helped to raise him.  The book is set in a small town in New York State some time in the 1830's.  Nathaniel meets Phoebe when he comes upon her in the woods where she is crying after having read a letter from her deceased mother.  Nathaniel is immediately taken with the beautiful, soft spoken Phoebe.  I loved Nate and Phoebe, but if I had to pick a favorite character it would be Miranda, Phoebe's friend and self appointed guardian angel.  Hiram is determined to marry Phoebe and refuses to accept her rejection of his proposal.  He and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to accept him as a husband and he literally begins to stalk the poor girl!  Everytime Phoebe left her house, Hiram would be there with his unwelcome presence.  Hiram took note of Nathaniel's attentions towards Phoebe and between that and her constant rejection of his suit he begins to hate her and Nathaniel and starts scheming against them.  All the while he is still determined to have Phoebe as his wife.  If not for the enterprising Miranda, he might very well have succeeded in his evil plot.  Other characters include Marcia and her husband David Spafford, the hero and heroine from the first book of the Schuyler trilogy entitled ""Marcia Schuyler.""  I have not as yet read that book, but have just been lucky enough to obtain a free copy and so intend to read that next.  I am also looking forward the 3rd and final book in the triology ""Miranda"" in which the beloved Miranda finally gets her love match.  This book invoked a wide range of real emotions in me.  I  lauged out loud at many of Miranda's escapades, I literally felt Phobe's pain and suffering, and I completely despised Hiram Green.  One scene in particular where he and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to travel alone with Hiram had me clenching my teeth and wishing I was there to kick Hiram's sorry ass!!!!  He gets his in the end though and very nicely too, thanks in part to Miranda, of course!  Love that girl! And of course, love conquers all when Nate and Phoebe get to sail off into the sunset to begin their happily ever after.  I highly, highly recommend this book.  Jane Austen lovers especially will love this book.  It is a nice clean truly romantic story that touched me deeply.","05 26, 2013",A310KT1UQC5UNU,Reading Fanatic (CMP),"Wonderful, Wonderful Story!",1369526400

I cannot understand why Phoebe sticks around being everyone's favorite doormat once she turns 18 and is legally released from her brother's guardianship.There were strong female protagonists created by other authors in the same time period, so the lack of complexity in Phoebe's character cannot be completely explained by time and place.  If you are interested in reading novels of this era, I highly recommend those written by Anna Katharine Green.

The visual descriptions and writing style are very, very good. The mystery falls into the cozy mystery style and is well thought out and plotted. The descriptions of flora and fauna are truly outstanding. Made this non-gardener want to go plant something.All that said, I did feel that Rachel and other characters could have been better developed. Personally, I probably would've enjoyed the book much more if I had gotten to know Rachel better. Hopefully, in future books of the series Rachel will be more fully developed and become more personable.I also wish the book had been longer. It reads more like a novella, which is fine, as it suited my mood at the time, but I think it should probably be labelled as novella rather than a novel. For me, a little more depth and length is required to truly merit the label novel and this lack of depth is what caused any disappointment I felt in the book.I liked Blind Malice enough,though, that I will certainly read more installments in the series and can recommend this first one to anyone who loves plants, flowers and gardening.

Her relationship with her lover is most unconvincing, as she asks him to wire her an enormous sum of money and agrees to marry him, but then doesn't bother to check her emails.The descriptions of the landscape take over pages of what should have been well-written mystery.

Since I read the other two out of order, I went back and started at the beginning.  Rachel Myers is a very appealing character because of her dedication to everything she does, and she is a very kind and moral person.  Coming from the mountains of North Carolina, a beautiful area of the country, she is used to making her own way in the world and also is used to hard work.  At the beginning of this series, she is a nursing administrator for a retirement home in Flagstaff, AZ.In this novel, Rachel has returned from Arizona, where she now lives, to her father's farm in North Carolina to attend his funeral. He had suffered a heart attack and was found in his home by Isaac, an old friend of her father's who lives on the farm property and helps with the work of the farm and kept her father company.  It comes to Rachel's attention that another friend of her father's from the past had become very interested in her father and his farm and had talked him into making some improvements on his property that weren't really necessary, and that had cost much more than Rachel's father would normally spend.  In addition to everything else, the housekeeper that Rachel's father had had for years, was now fired and gone. Something just wasn't right.When Rachel and Isaac together find out some other suspicious facts, Rachel knows that it is time to find out the truth about her father's estate, both the property and the money, and why certain things just aren't adding up.  Isaac is a great support to Rachel as she tries to find out what went on during the time since her last visit home.The descriptions of the North Carolina scenery on the trails that Rachel rides her horse on and of the mountains around the farm are a delight to read about, and are authentic since the author is a native of North Carolina.There is suspense, mystery and pleasant times with old friends in BLIND MALICE.  Now that I've read this one, it's on to another in this series.  These are very enjoyable mysteries.","12 8, 2011",A14QJKY3DA19AP,S. Warfield,A very pleasant mystery,1323302400

3283,B001V5JCTI,"[1, 2]",2,"The predominant issue with this book is the editing.  Just about every sentence is a run-on sentence.  I tried to ignore them, but reading them is the literary equivalent of tumbling down a hill.  On one page, the average sentence was five or six lines long -- all joined together with commas and very difficult to follow comfortably.Putting aside the editing issue (which I know the author is aware of, but hasn't yet fixed), the novel would be 2.5 or 3 stars.  The basic premise of the book -- retired police chief from Wisconsin helps solve mysteries in Palm Springs -- isn't bad, but the actual mechanics of it leave some questions.  I need more back story to help me understand why a small town police chief would have the ability to be especially good at solving these mysteries (the story of him just being a ""natural"" at profiling and even doing freelance profiling for the F.B.I. didn't ring true).  We never really saw Henry being good at figuring things out or having special insight into people.  He just sort of talks to people and the mystery solves itself.  It was kind of like watching your grandpa solve a case -- not a detective grandpa, but just your regular grandpa.I also had lingering questions about the plot.  The device of the autographed pictures didn't make sense.  I don't understand why somebody would be more likely to buy a house if there was an autographed picture of a celebrity in it . . . either you're an easy mark for that sort of scam or you aren't.  What was the picture supposed to convey -- that the celebrity had left an autographed picture of themselves before moving out?  It also didn't make sense that nobody on the police force wanted to solve the crime because they'd heard rumors that the victim liked to have sex with teenage boys.  Detectives can't just opt out of murder investigations -- they may do a halfway job, but they can't just call in a local volunteer.I give the author credit for attempting to create some characters that add life to the book.  Wayne and Henry were too alike to be distinguishable -- they need to be able to play off of each other better if this is going to be a successful series.  Charles was actually an good character and I can see the potential there.  It was jarring to have him continually introduce himself with ""Heeey,"" when no other dialogue had any sort of spelling alteration to imply dialect.  It was distracting and unnecessary.  The character of Amit was interesting in that you could see the author's attempt to surround Henry with characters who were very different -- Amit was young, of a different race and nationality, technically savvy, and very different in personality.  Like the vast majority of the dialogue, Amit's didn't ring true, but with more work and development (in dialogue and character), I can see this being a solid group and am hoping maybe Amit is being set up as a regular character.This has the potential to be a good series.  It isn't there yet, but I would check out future books if I felt the author addressed the editing, tightened plots, and focused on characterization.  I think there is room in the mystery world for a detective like Henry.","06 29, 2011",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,Potential with so-so plot and terrible editing,1309305600

3285,B001V5JCTI,"[1, 2]",2,"I really wanted to like this book, as I am a sucker for books set in Southern California, especially places where I either lived or visited many times. Palm Springs is in the latter category. While the opening chapter had promise, with its details of the real estate industry that ring true to me, the rest of the book was very disappointing.First of all, if the book was written in 2004, and there is no indication that it is a period piece set in the 1960s-1980s, then why name the protagonist Henry (outside of the royal family, I don't know many Henrys, especially one born in 1942: book set in 2004, Henry is 62, etc). And his wife's name was Irma? Why not Cynthia, or Nancy, or Linda -- names that were popular during the 1940s and don't have a whiff of the 1920s or 30s about them. They were married in the late 1960s -- not right after VJ Day! This may seem minor, but I have little interest in reading about a Henry, or an Irma, even though she dies before the story opens. It ages them for me --- gives, at least to me, an impression of a really, really old married couple.Next, there is far too much detail about the little things in Henry's life -- the razor Henry uses, what kind of sandwich old Irma ate before she died in their Las Vegas hotel room, the list goes on and on. As another reviewer noted, this seems like padding to bring up the word count. And the author jumped around with the back story on Henry and Irma -- I thought we were through with the back story, and there it comes again, right in the middle of Henry walking around the house where the murder took place.I am glad to read that the author is going to revise this book. I hope that he tightens the action, and doesn't give us every little detail of Henry's morning rituals, etc. as though he were Marcel Proust. As to the names --- well, we are probably stuck with them....I will keep checking for the revised version, as I still am hooked on the setting, and I admire anyone who takes the time to write and publish, knowing that he or she is opening themselves up to criticism.","06 24, 2011",AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,Ms Winston,Room for Improvement on this First Effort,1308873600

I liked Henry, and I thought his living arrangements had a lot of potential in subsequent books (and boy, would I like his house!).  I also liked the amount of detail that was given. Another reviewer referred to it as 'padding'.  Maybe it is, but I also liked the way it gave the story immediacy - you felt like you were right there, watching the goings-on.  The concept of a retired police chief helping out with current cases is no more or less implausible than most of the premises for most mysteries.  All things considered, most police departments nowadays would jump on the chance to have an expert, unpaid, consultant available!  I thought that the plot was interesting, the victim just 'shady' enough to be realistic.  My big gripe, if it can be called that, was with the ending when the murderer was revealed.  I don't necessarily dislike the author's decision on who should be First Murderer, but I didn't like the way he presented it - it was too sudden, too abrupt, and the clues leading to their identity were a bit too subtle and got lost in the shuffle, so to speak. If the author had eased Henry into his realization of who the murderer was more gradually and provided one more clue that pointed to that person, I think the ending would've been immeasureably improved.  All in all, this was a pleasant, easy read with a bit of a twist at the end.  I'd recommend it.Note on Kindle formatting:  Good.

Lack of commas results in run-on sentences that defy translation.  Errors like &#34;could of&#34; instead of &#34;could've&#34; or &#34;could have&#34; are frequent, and the writing style is amateurish and annoying.I would like to excuse all this by the fact that the author was born in Europe and so came to English as a second language.  But the biography indicates that a lot of writing has been done since then, so one would assume that a better grasp of the English language would have taken place at some time.  My husband came to this country at the age of 40 with six languages in his grasp, and, although he is not an author, his writing (when he does it) is absolutely correct.  Hmm.

I didn't get too many of the heroes though.  We've seen movies that villainize some of the chiefs,  I didn't get the full picture from those stories and didn't see that the natives weren't just sitting around thinking about ways to attack white settlements.  They just wanted to live, and they didn't want to be invaded; and they were frequently lied to.I enjoyed reading each story.  In some cases, a deal would be made with one white representative, and it was a genuine deal in good faith, but later, some other politician (or general) would just decide to change the deal for their own benefit.  It was good to read that the villains weren't always villains and the good guys weren't always the good guys.Mostly it was good to read the stories of people that would have otherwise been forgotten.","11 28, 2012",AUIJDXNYVTEA8,Les Stockton,well done,1354060800

Otherwise, you'll be saying ""huh?"" throughout the story.I judge my science fiction on a modified version of the Baen criteria: the scientific advances / future technology needs to be somewhat believable, if there are aliens they need to be presented in some realistic format with names I can pronounce in my head while I read, and must have some type of plot with circumstances - good or bad - with their resolution I can get my head around, believe, and be interested in turning to the next page to learn more; that's quite a mouthful, but we've all read a lot of bad science fiction over the years.With all that being said, this book hits it on most fronts - like Book One of the series I still can't pronounce the names of the alien races, but Book Two seems a bit rushed and incomplete to me.  There's not too much interaction with Daniel, and (without having a spoiler) I found a couple of the situations near the end a bit unrealistic.  The author did a great job setting the stage for ten years since the conclusion of Book One, then about two-thirds into the Kindle version it seemed as if there must have been a mad push to get this story told, completed, and out the door.  Many scenes could / should have been developed more as they were incomplete.I still enjoyed the series overall.  The author left it open at the end as if there might be a sequel, but I will probably wait and see what other reviewers think of it instead of immediately rushing out to buy it as I did with this one.

However, it was clear that he has little &#34;real&#34; experience in shipboard life or with military structure and command personalities.  All of his characters are exagerated stereotypes and the interpersonal exchanges would have resulted in few of these protagonists ever reaching command because of the obvious psycholoogical abberations present.One sure indicator of his unfamiliarity with naval (spaceship or surfaceship) life is his lubberly use of &#34;the&#34; before ship names.  We who have spent many years and many deck watches know that a manned ship is truly a living entity, christened at its birth (launching), and possessing the nature and personality of its officers and crew.  Use of &#34;the&#34; before its given name is akin to referring to this book's author as &#34;the David Derrico.&#34;Also, as Isaac Azimov pointed out repeatedly, good science fiction must be good science.  I was appalled when the good Admiral referred to &#34;a new element&#34; as part of the alien hull.

Thanks, anyway.&#34; You probably feel guilty or pained because it means a lot to the person and it really would make them happy for you to show an interest in the thing that they enjoy, but try as you might, you just can't imagine this book in your lifetime, or for that fact, the next one either. This book had no true blaring faults when I read the synopsis, but when I read it I worried I might be having that feeling because it would be a &#34;boy-centric&#34; Sci-fi. BUT I WAS WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! It was sort of &#34;boy-centric&#34;story but I totally got into this book and loved it hard.Stan Morris's Surviving The Fog begins with a group of youths between the ripe ages of twelve and eighteen spending a three week stay at a summer camp retreat in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California for an abstinence camp. They are there to learn about different birth control methods but ultimately to make a pact when faced with a sexual situation to take the high road and abstain. But shortly into their stay the Admin of the camp and the Counselors go lost and never return leaving roughly fifty youths with one counselor whose mental stability quickly devolves leaving them all alone. Knowing something very wrong has occurred thirteen year old Mike and his friend sixteen year old John attempt to make contact with the outside. When this fails they spearhead taking control of the camp before things get out of hand. It takes a while before a hierarchy is established but when it does, it is thirteen year old Mike who is the &#34;Chief&#34; of those left in the camp.When I started the book I had the odd feeling I was dealing with the set up of a 1980's slasher film. The young adults, isolated with the ominous feeling of impending suspenseful doom. Danger awaiting them and always a threat. After a couple of threats that feeling disappeared and something reminiscent of a happy telling of Lord of the Flies came to mind. Once it really got rolling I wanted more and more to keep going. I really didn't want to put it down.A whole lot happens in this book from point 'A' to 'B' and a good deal of detailed steps that add many dimensions to the large cast of young adult characters. Eventually, they come into contact with more people and their camp becomes the village of Petersburg--named for one of the founding members who helped establish peace at the camp at the start of the story. The happenings during the expansion will disturb many readers brought up in the black and white societal view delineating when a child becomes an adult. Also probably rural and urban upbringing will see the relationships that occur in this book differently as well. Many people will be offended or have argument with the later portion of the story.This story is a rather romantic view of communal living as a best possible outcome. Stan Morris's character's faith in human goodness and their ability to do what is best for one another in the face of a crisis is the vehicle that carries the story. For the most part the encounters with inhumanity that occur within the book are met with swift and severe punishment. It's the very definition of dura lex sed lex, the law is hard, but it is the law. However, in a times when humanity is tested, inhumanity will gather its forces. I really felt that there should have been a great deal more grief and strife. More uprising and usurping of power. The history of man does not really show a history of peace. Most of man's time on earth has been spent in bloodshed and a thirst for domination.The book had many issues which need a tune up. As good as the novel is it is just a little too long; it needed to be edited down just a bit so it wasn't so heavy to shoulder. I had no real beef with the simple writing style. Many might complain that Stan Morris's writing is too basic or undeveloped but for this book. The narrative being that of a thirteen year old boy, I truly thought he hit the nail on the head. The novel was too male centric and desperately needed to be balanced by more active respected female characters. I also felt that despite the pairing of couples that there never seemed to be any rhyme or reason for those relationships. I think he could have worked on developing a better psychological connection between them so it wasn't as dry and clinical as it came across.I wish I knew of books to compare this too but in my mind it really stands alone. I do recommend it and I'm suggesting it as a Weekend Pick Me Up but this one is one for a snowy or rainy weekend where you need to be taken away and forget this world for a little time. (This review was written for my blog All The Things Inbetween at Alicrean.com)Kathy's Synopsis:Kathy&#8217;s Recollections is about a group of teenagers attending a camp in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The camp was designed to preach abstinence and teach methods of birth control.  After a week, the cell phones are not connecting, and the mail has not been delivered, so the camp administrator and most of the counselors leave for a short visit to a nearby convenience store.  They never return.  After another week it become clear to one boy that something has gone seriously wrong in the world.  Then the campers discover that they are surrounded by a mysterious brown fog that appears to cover the earth below 6,700 feet.  The story is narrated by fourteen year old Kathy.  She focuses on their efforts to survive the elements, outsiders, and each other.","01 24, 2014",A12LBZWQYC74EU,"Ali Crean ""~Blogger: All the Things Inbetween""",Weekend Pick Me Up - Surviving The Fog by Stan Morris,1390521600

I'm not sure if they are from bad formatting or from author/editor error, so I won't fault the author on that.  However, I do fault the author for not being able to decide if he was writing for an adult audience or a YA audience.  I wish he had made up his mind.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but sometimes it felt childish and other times it seemed a bit 'too much'.  YA-lit is a tough thing to write.  It's always a fine line between being too watered down and being over the top.Also, everything seems 'too easy' and 'too convenient'.  Everything the kids need falls in their laps.  They want to build a better shelter - a guy from a logging camp shows up.  A girl is pregnant - they find a nurse.  It would be interesting to see how the kids had handled the birth of a baby with no medical help.  It would have also been nice to see the kids fail once in a while.  I know there were bad guys around and they killed people and caused problems, but I'm not talking about that kind of thing.  It would have been nice if one of the kids ideas had not worked.  ""Lets make this...Lets build that"" and every idea works out perfectly.  That's not realistic.  It's ok to fail at a task.  People learn from their mistakes and people can learn from reading other people's mistakes too.I'm all for supporting new authors, and I do give the guy credit for coming up with a good idea.  I just wish he had proof read a little better and did some re-writes to fix parts of the story that don't flow well.  Also, the first chapter could be dropped completely and it would make the story flow much better.

The purpose of writing a story is too take your reader on a trip. I thought Mr. Morris did a great job of telling me a story. When you tell a story you OFTEN don't use the perfect verbiage that you might use in your doctoral dissertation. That is because it is a story and SHOULD be told in the voice of the people in the story. I also am a writer AND I live in the South. I often use words like y'all and ain't in my stories.

Let me tell you, My Dad graduated high-school when he was 15. WW2 was in high gear and he couldn't enlist because he was too young. He went to Dallas and worked in an aircraft factory for a year and then enlisted in the Navy the day after his 16th birthday. His Grandfather was in the trenches in France when he was that age. One ancestor fought at Shiloh in the Civil War when he was 14! Another died at the battle of San Jacento when Texas defeated the Mexicans and earned our freedom. He was 17!

What I felt detracted the most, from the very intriguing storyline, was the utterly ignorant reason for the camp.  An abstinence camp!  Seriously?  Educate and abstain?  I got the irony that in the end they were all ending up pregnant, but it was just stupid.  It actually took away from the storyline, and was ridiculous at best.  There they had huge, vast, bunches upon bunches, of birth control supplies, but they ended up pregos in the end anyway.  Some of the kids attending the camp were as young as twelve!  This was just a really stupid part of the story that only a man could come up with.  And, by the way, diaphragms are not even remotely like condoms.

After it comes in, you have to take it back to the doctor for the fitting.  I was just shaking my head when I read some of the stuff about having a large supply of condoms and diaphragms to give out to their friends later.  Condoms...maybe, but not diaphragms.  If this author wants to improve this story, just make the camp a regular camp.

3413,B001V9KG4E,"[7, 10]",2,"Plot/Storyline: 2 StarsThe novel started with a storline that was reminiscent of modern day Lord of the Flies, by William Golding. Unfortunately, that small similarity of teens building their own society is pretty much it for likeness.The premise is faulty from the beginning. A bunch of young kids are camping. I'm not certain of the youngest, but the oldest camper is seventeen. I know at least one is as young as thirteen. Then, when communication is cut off with the outside world, five of the six counselors leave the sixth and youngest counselor, a twenty-year old alone with all those teenagers. I cannot imagine any adults making such a decision.Then, out of all those kids and the one counselor, only one teen decides to try to find out what happened. I would have thought several would have wanted to hike down the mountain to find some adults, but the rest almost immediately start deciding what to do about winter, just assuming they will be there still.Any sense of suspense is ruined constantly by little remarks thrown in referring to things way into the future. The author seemed intent on making sure the reader knew that the kids would never be `rescued' from the very beginning. The kids certainly don't seem very concerned about being rescued with all of them willing to pretty much blindly follow one of the youngest boys in the group.The plot has very little to do with the fog or its origins. It simply focused completely on these kids creating a little society of their own. I will say that it was obvious that a lot of thought and planning went into the storyline. But, the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.Character Development: 1 StarThe characters were flat and lifeless. The author was disinclined to give any back story on the main characters, so the reader must draw their own conclusions as to the kids' personalities and how they came to be.Writing Style: 2 StarsWhereas the subject matter may not be appropriate for young teens, the writing style was of that type of simplicity. Not only was the sentence structure coarse and unrefined, but the flow came in staccato bursts that was just exhausting to read. The time flow explanations were confusing, too.The descriptions were so sparse that I could not picture a character or a scene during the entire novel. The dialogue was decent in some places, but mostly stilted and uninteresting.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors throughout, but not enough to be a big issue. The formatting was of professional quality.Rating: PG-17 for Violence, Rape, and Adult Situations","02 18, 2010",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,2 1/2 Stars,1266451200

3426,B001V9KG4E,"[40, 50]",2,"This book really confused me. I was able to put most of my questions aside and enjoy the book for what it was- a Swiss Family Robinson story about teenagers.OK, now for my many quibbles:1) This book would be YA but there's lots of sexual innuendo and implied sex scenes.  Ok, so I guess I'm an old fogey and am forgetting that the young'uns are maturing way faster than before.  But this is what I really don't like about the book- the fact the ""adults"" in the story (defined pretty much as everybody over the age of 20) start pairing off with...the teenagers. Yup. The chief of teens instigates a rule that you cant have sex before age 16, and maybe a couple that is 16 and 20 or 21 is ok.  But what we have are, err, a mature mother of two (I think she's close to 30) and a 16 year old (she does joke about robbing the cradle but then follows up confessing she has erotic dreams about him).  Then there's a construction worker/handyman who has to be in his mid-20's at least, who gets in bed (but no sex! yeah right!) with a...14 year old girl.  I'm sure you will love the scenes where he fantasizes about her perky, err, bottom clothed in skinny jeans, and the day she wears a teeny tiny skirt.  Very uncomfortable reading this, to say the least.2) So, teens will be teens. Referring to my comment #1, the sex between the teens, though slightly unsavory, is realistic in the end.  Now, oddly enough, the premise for bringing them all together is the fact they were all attending an abstinence camp.  Whizz goes the irony! sorry, though, there were no religious connotations at all in the book. Nor did these seem like your bunch of bad behaving kids sent to labour camp. Is there really, really such a thing as an abstinence camp that is not related to the church? Did the author just choose this setting for the irony?3) Again, teens will be teens. I'm alright with some of them being more mature and taking charge, even if the Chief is a 15 year old. But what about the emotions? It really seemed the kids took one paragraph to get over the shock of being stuck atop the mountain...then boom, they are back to playing and chatting. No thoughts of mom or dad? Siblings? Friends back home? It's like these kids shrug at the fact life as they know it has changed drastically. Kids are resilient but to have none of them freak out and break down emotionally at the thought of being alone with no family is just really bizarre.4) The gender issue. Hey, I'm a girl and I once was a teenager. I will admit at one point, all I cared about was getting a phone in my room. I was extremely shallow with my clothing, makeup, friends. So no surprise at some of the girls' behavior in this book.  However, for ALL of them to be such sheep? The two girls who join the ""inner circle"" (the group in charge) admit that most of their acceptance by the guys  is because they're the ""girlfriends."" and then the Chief blurts that fact out loud. Reaction?  Nada. I think a few girls toss their hair and/or stomp off to pout. But that's really about it. Geez would it kill to have the girls actually gang up and retaliate a bit?5) The ""science""...or lack thereof. There's a weird fog surrounding the mountain. there's creepy stuff in it that kills. According to the prologue the fog is alien in nature or something like that. Ooooh. But then that's the only mention of the fog in that context. Dang it, would it kill to have one or more of the teens try to investigate the fog? Or the ""army specialists"" do some research into the fog?  Everyone just seems to lie back and accept it all. Not one thought on how to escape. Ugh!Well there's more but I feel I've ranted enough.

I had this book sitting on my kindle for a week or so not bothering to read it because some of the reviews made it sound only mediocre. I sat down and read this through in one sitting. It was great. It did have quite a few typos, and misprints but for crying out loud its a self published book THATS FREE!I would love it if the author was able to make the book $3.00 and get some money for his work so that he could write a second. For a debut novel which I believe this is, it was a stellar performance. The character development was great. I could have used a little more antagonist descriptions ( its good to also get to know the bad guys we don't like), but the good guys were very knowable lovable. Sure parts were a little far fetched but its fantasy fiction?This book is chock full of heroism, good characters making common sense decisions honorably and humor.I would really like to see the story develop more, and a great way to do it would be to write it from the perspective of other survivors and give more ""alien"" information. HINT HINT.I would buy a book two for anything under $5.00 (my usual kindle cap) without hesitation.The language and sexuality and violence would all be rated about a soft PG-13.

This author has a hard time with possessives--both singular and plural, seems unsure of the difference between ""it's"" and ""its"" and repeatedly uses the phrase ""use to"" as in, ""They weren't use to powdered milk.""  It's supposed to be ""used to"".  These seem like small quibbles, but many people judge writing both by content and by skill with spelling and grammar.

I was very happy to find out that it is not.The story is about a campground of mostly pre-teens, who end up being without any adult supervision after a fog, of unknown but deadly variety, cuts them off from most of the world.The only adult that was left at the campground was a 20 year old counselor, who seems to withdraw into herself and out of the issues that are coming up.A small group of kids end up taking charge of the group. And they do very well at it. The leader, nicknamed Chief, is Mike, a 13 year old teen. Nobody else seems to even have any ideas of what to do, other than himself and a few of their friends.This book takes place over a time period of about 3 years. Mike is 13 when it starts and is one week shy of 16 when it ends.I didn't have much of a problem with some of the age differences. One of the couples was a 17 year old teen and a early to mid 20's woman. I didn't find that at all unusual, or upsetting. I thought that the remarkable strength, of 20 year old man who is sexually targeted by a 14 year girl, was kind of neat.It does need some editing.

3443,B001V9KG4E,"[4, 5]",3,"This book gets a lot of negative reviews. I read them before I decided to invest nothing in the book except the time to read it. I enjoyed reading it. Had I found anything really poorly done, I would have sent this book right off to the deepest archive as I have sent several books that I could not recommend. But, if you have the time, I recommend reading this book.I think the author is young - no older than 25. I say that partly because I wrote a few short stories similar to this in many ways during the period age 15 to 20 when I was in high school and college. I always thought I would write more when I got old and retired from daily pay-the-bills-type work. I haven't written anything because I have almost decided I don't have anything I want to tell anybody. That's the trouble. This kid has put together a story of youths overcoming adversity that displays plenty of youthful optimism and enthusiasm. That's what kept me turning the pages. That's what you lose when you grow old enough to be a good writer with a lot of wisdom and insight into the human condition!A quick review: Mike is 13 and spending a few weeks at a summer camp near the 7,000 ft mark in the Sierra Mountains of California with about 50 other kids and one counselor. The other kids range from 12 to 16 and the counselor is about 22 with some medical training. There were a bunch of other adult counselors but they left to get more supplies and did not return. The boys do a little scouting, as curious boys will, and discover a fog that surrounds as much of their area as they can see, rising to the 6600 ft level. They see birds and deer run into the fog and hear scary screams as these animals remain in the fog. So they conclude that nobody is going very far for a while. They form a small organization led by Mike, who seems to be the only person concerned with their well fare, to gather and preserve food and to build shelters good enough to last the winter. This all lasts several years as they run into bad guys who rape and kill (forcing the boys and girls to kill them with spears and arrows and a hangman's noose) and they establish a set of rules to cover all problems: for example, no sex before you are 16. They discover other people who are nice and helpful so their shelters and food resources are improved. They even find the US Army, or a small contingent, that is just as stranded as they are. It all turns out well in the end. Eventually, many of them marry and start a new generation that can survive the fog. Even Mike eventually gets married. He marries an Army Sargent whom he meets after you read 96% of the book. When they first meet she keeps saying "" that's Sargent Ann Jenkins to you, Kid!"" But then he stands down a big brown bear facing it with only his spear, and they become romantically involved. (You had to have been there!) 2.5 years later she becomes pregnant.There is a slight flaw in the story. Nowhere in the book do we get a description of this lovely Annie. We know she is big enough and strong enough to pick Mike up off his toes grabbing his shirt. But we don't know if she is dark haired or light haired, medium tall or very tall, skinny or fat ....

3445,B001V9KG4E,"[3, 3]",3,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I feel that the idea of the book was a good one (what would survival after a catastrophic event look like).However I felt the characters were not appropriate for the adversity and the challenging experiences that the author wanted to explore.Let me say that I felt there was a fair amount of thought put into the steps needed to have the characters survive. This was a strong plus towards making the in the book creditable, if not for the characters ages.I liked that the book took place over two and a half year time frame, giving opportunities for us (the reader) to see how the characters lives might unfold and what other issues would come up.What I did not like about the book can be narrowed down to two things.One (and this was the biggest) was that the age of the characters was simply too young to cover the issues that the author was trying to tackle, making it all seem less believable.For example our main character 'Chief' Mike. At age 13 and a half, he takes on the role of leader for the surviving teenagers. The concerns and decisions that he comes up with are far greater then what a 13 year old would come up with. Even given that he might be more 'mature' emotionally then others his age, however there is no explanation as to 'Why' he would be more mature in his understanding of life and leadership. Without this explanation, his 'judgements' and 'rules' do not sit right with reality. I am left to say, ""That's pretty wise for an early teenager, and where is his teen emotions?""I could do this same break down with the remaining characters, but you can get the idea with this one and I shouldn't go on and on about that.The next issue that I have with the book is that often the mini-crises in the story do not flow with the over all story. They seem to be cut and pasted into the storyline. It would have been more realistic to have less events play out then to have the extra mini-crises.For example the whole lodge situation, it was announced, then left until the last part of the book to be hastily played out. I felt it was poorly played out leaving me feeling flat about its resolution.So what do I think of the story and do I recommend it?I think it is worth the read, but one should have low expectations, just as you would for a 'made for T.V.' movie as opposed to a 'made for the theater' movie. If you lower your expectations you probably will enjoy this book. Because I actually did enjoy it once I finally decided just to let the 'issues' be and imagine the characters say five years older (each).Due to some of the content (rape, murder and violence) within the book, I would recommend it to readers above the age of 16.I would like to see other works by this author, as I enjoyed the storyline, and feel that maybe in time the author will improve his craft.","04 13, 2012",A1U3LIALASYOLZ,T.

Now I'm an anti-Harry Potter sort of person, so when I saw an amulet was involved I was a little wary. I also come from a completely different writing culture. I needn't have worried!  William has the gift of writing , well what I'd call young adults stories, though anyone could read this and be blessed. He has that knack which pulls you into the perspective of Brian, and tells the tale from a child of his age's point of view. The whole text has for me that wonderful fairytale feeling that I love in the Elizabeth Goudge stories such as the Little White Horse.Brian is maybe old for his age due to the abuse he has suffered in his life but he also acts just like a teenager.  His journey to find the Living water is has great narrative tension and I'm glad that it went on long enough after the climax to make the ending balanced and it sort of ties in to the supernatural of the story.I began thinking, ok, so this is a magical story in many ways, just how would this appeal to any teenager?  Its adventure with a twist of romance, reality and excitement. Yet as a Christian, how is this tale justified. (see my standpoint above).  Of course William related this to the Native Americans, and has a bible verse. Then it hit me, maybe I'm being dense, and William  had this in mind but the whole book is one huge allegory or metaphor.  Come to me and drink the streams of living water (John 4, v 13-14) . As Christians, we all seek and drink the living water of Christ and our lives should then reflect and bless all around them. This is what Brian and Rachel did with their lives. It gives you the gospel message that through Christ we can be all things and bless others.  This book does it in a way acceptable to the teenage mind if they can see it!

This was such a moving and thought provoking story to be aimed at a younger audience but I think older readers would enjoy it too. William Woodall really gets into the mind of a 14 year old boy. What I like about this author is that he's not trying to be like anyone else. He's not copycating C.S. Lewis like so many others try to do. He's not afraid to approach the Christian aspect but he doesn't beat anyone over the head with it either.  His work is unique and I really enjoy it.I think he should have included discussion questions at the end of this book because there are so many ways to start a conversation with the many themes it contains.I would give the writing 4 stars only because the characters weren't as distinct as in other books I have read by this author. For instance, the names Brandon and Brian were so similar I kept confusing them. I thought the two main characters could have used something in their speech to set each one apart. I really enjoyed the unique way he has of putting things though. Here's an example.""Nor did he dream, except the sweet and simple dreams of the pure at heart, of the kind that nourish the soul but are never remembered.""I should also mention that the writing reminded me of a bedtime story in places. Some people might find that a bit distracting but I felt it added to the fairy-tale fantasy feel. I give the story line 5 whole stars.

She is the type of person you really want to hate.  You don&#8217;t hear much about the father until later on. This story, although fantasy has so much to teach us.  When Brian finds the amulet he kind of lets the power go to his head.  I have been a fan of the TV show &#8220;Once Upon A Time&#8221;.  Mr. Gold aka Rumplestiltskin has a saying every time someone comes to him for magic.  He reminds them that they need to remember that &#8220;magic comes with a price&#8221;.  It seems that Brian never thought about the price of using the amulet until it was almost too late.  What I didn&#8217;t understand was why his mom waited so long to let him know she knew he had it.  It added another layer of hardness and uncaring to her character.  This story has a redemptive side.  This is an allegorical novel.  It can be read by young and old, Christian and Non-Christian and be enjoyed by all.  I read this as an e-book.  This is a book I most definitely want to get for my classroom.  I even know which student is going to get to check it out first.  This is definitely an author that needs to be recommended more often.

3464,B001VEI1NC,"[2, 3]",5,"I started reading this book without knowing exactly what it was, but the first lines already caught me. The beginning is almost traumatic. Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed. Which happens often.If it were a movie in theaters, I would say that the ticket costed very little, if the price is divided by the number of deaths. And this aspect, if we talk about drug trafficking and especially action, is undoubtedly positive.Really an excellent reading.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return","05 11, 2012",A3RMCZMUUTFXSB,"Anakina ""Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli""",Action and fun,1336694400

Eric works his way up the drug smuggling organisation and although extreme violence and high body count the violence is almost so over the top that it just adds to the atmosphere rather than shocks. All of the characters are well developed and the plot is quite straightforward although there is a twist at the end it again does not seem likely.Summary an action packed book where you have to suspend belief but very readable with some good ideas.

The first part of the book involves the steps required to learn or decide what or who you want to be.  This is not as easy as it seems.

This in depth look at what we want is very important if we are to manifest ourselves and become what we want.

He did not know who he was or who he wanted to become.  He had these ill defined goals and he had plenty of baggage preventing him from realizing even these ill defined goals.

There is sure to be lots of sexual tension and participation, right?  WRONG!  There should be some kind of sticker put on the back of this book: WARNING - may contain highly emotional content that may not be suitable for all readers.  Oh sure, Shiloh Walker tells you AT THE END of the book, but at that point you are already read the emotionally hard parts.Playing for Keeps starts out as a story about three people: Dana, the free spirited woman looking for commitment-free fun, Mason, the current lover that provides the fun, and Jake, the love torn on-again-off-again boyfriend of the woman he loves that flees at the hint of relationship-related seriousness.  Mason is an excuse in this book, so for the most part it is all about Jake and Dana.  The book starts off with Jake sharing Dana with another man; the only way he is able to be with Dana without her freaking out.  It moves along to just Dana and Jake when they find out they are going to be surprise parents.  Then, unfortunately, moves into a terrible tragedy that threatens their fledgling relationship.  Can their love survive?Jake is like a lovesick puppy, following around the object of his desire over the course of years.  When he does get the chance to snag Dana, he grabs on with both hands.  There is not a lot of seething rage toward the man that he must share his love with.  Don't get me wrong, he hates Mason, but he wants Dana happy more and the m&eacute;nage relationship makes her so.  When he finds out that she is pregnant, he steps up to the plate and takes responsibility.  Good man.  I really liked the realism that Jake gives off.  I like seeing him respond with Dana's wishes in mind, instead of just his own.Dana, on the other hand, likes to play.  She is not the type of woman that thinks about settling down and starting a family as being her top priority.  So when news of an unexpected baby arrives, she is forced to reevaluate her life.  And when her heart is heavy with loss, she discovers what is truly important to her.  It was nice to see the growth bloom within Dana's character.  Even though the story itself is rather on the skimpy side of size, nothing about any of the character's developments seems rushed.***SPOILER ALERT***Now let's move to the part that I warned you about earlier.  The loss of an unborn child is tremendous.  You do not have to hold the baby in your arms to love it and feel the weight of their loss.  From personal experience, the sadness does not ever go away, just lessens enough for you to function.  Sad to say that in this type of tragedy, sometimes the men are overlooked in terms of grief.  Most relationships do not last after losing a child; either parent cannot deal with their grief or that of their partner's.  But there are some that grow closer in the aftermath.  Ms. Walker and I are two such cases.  I applaud her in sharing the story of her and her husband's  own experience with her readers, no matter how much it hurt personally to read and experience these events all over again.  And though I am happy with the ending of this book, I most likely will not re-read it anytime soon.***END SPOILER***Shiloh Walker is known for her dramatic prose and hard/dark themes.  Her writing will touch you, no matter your circumstances, long after the book is done.  I highly recommend any of her many stories, from her contemporary romances, to the paranormal and erotic.  But I, again, warn you that this one in particular can be an emotional roller coaster.  If you start crying, don't say that I didn't tell you ahead of time.FTC Advisory: The author provided me with a copy of Playing for Keeps.

She was enjoying the pleasure of being with two men, and although she knew it couldn't last forever, she was going to play hard until it was time for their threesome to be over.  Both her men had to die for physiques.  Mason Caldwell set her body aflame, and she had been seeing him for a long time, but she has always known that he wasn't a keeper.  Emotions never came into play between them.  It was another story when it came to Jacob McCoy.  She had known him most of her life.  They were first and foremost friends that had become lovers one rainy storm filled night.  She had dated him in high school, college, and now they were intimate again.Jake has loved Dana his entire life.  Seeing her at the hospital where they both worked was difficult enough, but since she lived across the street from him, seeing her with Mason was killing him.  He never intended to become involved in a m&eacute;nage, but if it was the only way he could have her then he would take what he could get.  It took everything in him to keep his cool around Mason.  He just wanted to shout out his undying love from the rooftop.  Jake wanted a real relationship with Dana, and hoped that someday his wish would be granted.This is a very sensual but a highly emotional story.  Most of this story is told from Jake's point of view, and we get to see his inner struggle.  He has longed for Dana his entire life, and to be forced to share her is almost more than he can bare.","03 25, 2009",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Playing For Keeps,1237939200

He doesn't dare tell her. He knows her too well. Whenever it comes to deep emotion, Dana keeps everyone at arms length. Playing, however, is her forte, and one night when a storm has taken out the power on the street they live on, Jake walks across to check on her, only to find her and her boyfriend in the back yard in an intimate situation. Dana comes off the porch to stand in the rain in front of him, and her entreaty is too much to resist. Ignoring his possessive nature and his dislike of her casual boyfriend Mason, he gives in to the woman he loves and joins them.Dana knows that Mason is just a good time, that Jake is forever, but she's just interested in playing, enjoying her sexuality now that she has two men who will share her. She plays with them both, unconcerned, until one encounter with Jake changes her life. When you know you're going to be a mother, you start to realize either  playtime is over...or you have to start playing for keeps. And telling Jake and Mason takes that to a whole other level.What started out as a relatively simple menage a trois erotica romance novella with Walker's classic intense romantic angst takes a turn after that and becomes a much more serious and emotionally powerful and poignant story of love and unspeakable loss. I have nothing against the first part, really, but it lacked a bit in depth and character development for my tastes. The second part was so intense, however, and the emotions so vibrant and real as Jake and Dana try to survive a tragedy that shakes them to the soul, that it utterly eclipsed the beginning and made it seem shallow.I can't say I enjoyed the second part - it was very dark for the genre - but it was very well written and felt very emotionally honest. I have to give Walker credit for the courage and strength to write something so personally devastating. I also have to admit I loved the end and appreciated the hope and joy and promise that was reintroduced.

When I did though, I could not stop reading.  I liked the character of Julia and I am interested to find out more about Brisbane.  I think switching from UF to this book, more of a historical mystery, was a little jarring and that is why it took me a bit to get into it.  The writing is well done, and while the story is a little slower paced at the beginning, it really picks up at the end and left me wanting more.  Since this was the three-book bundle, I jumped right into the second book!Silent in the Sanctuary - I liked this book more than the first.

I really loved Rosalie and how the story of Brisbane's early years turned out.  The Allenbys were one messed up family.

3486,B001VLXMB6,"[76, 77]",4,"THIS is why I love my Kindle...three great books for the price of one.  After reading the reviews I thought the Julia Grey trilogy would be worth reading, and for $10 I was willing to gamble on the omnibus edition.  It was a good bet.The Julia Grey books are hybrid mystery-romances set in the Victorian period, best suited to readers who enjoy both genres.  Mystery is the dominant element in each book, but the romance between Julia Grey and Nicholas Brisbane is the backbone to the trilogy.  The slow, methodical development of the mysteries is nicely counterbalanced by the tempestuous relationship that develops between Julia and Brisbane.  The writing is elegant and rich, and it was a real pleasure to immerse myself in it.The omnibus contains all three books in the trilogy:SILENT IN THE GRAVE - This introduces us to our heroine, Lady Julia Grey, and begins with her husband's murder.  As the winning first line of the novel tells us: ""To say that I met Nicholas Brisbane over my husband's dead body is not entirely accurate. Edward, it should be noted, was still twitching upon the floor.""  Julia had been quiet, obedient, and dull all her life - the freedom of widowhood sparks a journey of self-discovery.  When Julia realizes her husband was murdered, more than a year after he died, she is determined to find the killer - no matter how cold the trail.  To succeed, she needs the help of Nicholas Brisbane, the private investigator her late husband hired before his death to investigate a series of ominous threats.SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY - This second book takes place at the family seat in Sussex, a converted abbey in the dead of winter.  The novel is richly atmospheric - a holiday party is trapped inside the fantastical gothic structure during a terrible snowstorm.  One among them is murdered, and another must be the culprit.  There are gypsies, ghosts roaming the stone-flagged halls, secret passages, impecunious relatives and a talking raven named Grim.  But SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY turns these gothic cliches on their heads as Julia and Brisbane race against time to find the murderer before the snow melts.SILENT IN THE MOORS - Like the second book, this one picks up - and transforms - a cliche: a dark, ominous, half-ruined estate in the northern moors of Yorkshire, capped by a rotting manor house, where dark family secrets fester.  Brisbane has acquired the estate, and his letters back to London indicate that something is very wrong - although he won't say exactly what.  Julia makes the journey north to investigate her relationship with Brisbane, and provide what help she can.  She's soon caught up in a proper mystery, featuring a family of aristocrats ruined by pride and a pair of mummified corpses hidden in a monk's hole.I devoured the trilogy.  The atmosphere of each book is wonderfully distinct and Raybourn does a wonderful job setting the scene - it's full of rich period detail, and everyone has a story to tell.  The whole cast of characters is magnificent, including every single member of Julia Grey's rather large family - she's one of ten children.  Although I sometimes solved the whodunit a little early in the story, Raybourn usually isn't content with just one crime: there's usually a tangle of them, and always had to wait for the end to see every detail unraveled.Brisbane is a dark, dangerous, mysterious sort of hero - easy to fall for, but terribly frustrating.  Sexy as he is, at times I really wondered if he was worth the trouble.  The romance is stretched out over all three volumes, and Julia and Brisbane's relationship is at least nominally professional - readers will be panting after the cracks in their professional facade.  At the end of the day, I still wished Brisbane had been a little warmer - and I am usually a big fan of brusque, brooding heroes.I started the trilogy expecting something along the lines of Dorothy Sayers, but the homage was really towards the Bronte sisters, Gothic mysteries, and maybe a dash of Sherlock Holmes.

The three books in this very nicely priced ebook bundle were much more mystery than romance, but that's okay. They were engaging and well constructed. The underlying romance -- which in these three books take Julia and Brisbane from first meeting to marriage -- is subtle but gripping.

I wouldn't really call them romances, although they do have a romantic undercurrent, and the dark character of Nicholas Brisbane grows on you after awhile.

Much of the second book, ""Silent in the Sanctuary"" seemed highly improbable and it involved more than one mystery.  I finished it but never felt it was engrossing and it took me a lot longer to read it.  I probably would rate it as 2 stars.  I don't plan to read the third one any time soon.

3505,B001VLXMD4,"[0, 0]",4,"Let me first say that I enjoy Brenda Jackson's character development. Each Westmoreland male is interesting and unique. The heroines are all professional, intelligent, ""virgins"". Surprisingly each heroine is a virgin over the age of 25 with the exception of Madison who had one prior sexual experience. In my opinion it is not realistic of your average woman over 25 years of age to be a virgin (while ideal and sweet not realistic). But I still say that Brenda Jackson's characters are wonderful. In the family of the Westmoreland's it is believed that they will all marry a person with whom they fall in love with at first sight. Love at first sight was believable with brothers Dare and Storm. Their love interests were women they had known for years. I did not buy the ""love at first sight"" theme between Delaney Westmoreland and Prince Jamal nor Stone and Madison. Again, romantic idea but unbelievable. The other three I bought it and loved it.I most enjoyed A Little Dare, it was my favorite of the first 5 books. Thorn Westmoreland is my favorite character from the series. I enjoyed his story as well. Stone Cold Surrender and Riding the Storm are the reasons I'm giving this review 3.5 stars. I thought the heroines were a bit extreme.  Madison tracking her 50 year old mom in the mountains of Montana and Jayla yet in her 20's choosing to be artificially inseminated because she's lonely. I thought that was extremely selfish. However each story has a satisfying end. Stone Cold Surrender has the redeeming aspect of Corey and Abby finding each other after so many years. I really enjoyed their part of the book. Their story touched my heart.

Nola is an Amazon warrior that has been cursed with invisibility after losing the same treacherous games. Now these enemies are finally coming together to break free of the curses that have befallen them. Well I wanted to read this novella immediately after finishing the Atlantis series, but I didn&#8217;t have an e-reader until now. I thought this would be amazing, heart stopping, satisfying romance novella. It was satisfying, but not heart stopping or amazing. I had really high expectations for this novella because I really liked Nola and Zane in The Vampire&#8217;s Bride.The main female character is Nola. Nola is a lot more likable in the novella. If you&#8217;ve read The Vampire&#8217;s Bride you&#8217;ll know how she pretty much ruined Zane&#8217;s life anyway she could get and absolutely hated and lusted after him. I like Nola, but compared to Delilah, her fellow Amazon, she wasn&#8217;t as strong as a character. She didn&#8217;t have a presence. She was there, but not really there; which is really ironic to say because of the curse. I didn&#8217;t even realize it until I thought about it. I&#8217;m a genius.Kick-Butt Heroine Scale: 7The main male character is Zane. I really liked Zane in The Vampire&#8217;s Bride. I was rooting for his happiness. I loved his attitude, but he seemed a lot more broken The Amazon&#8217;s Curse. It made it really hard for me to like him. I just didn&#8217;t like him as much. It was a bit of a letdown because I liked him a lot previously.Swoon Worthy Scale: 7The Villain- The Amazons are the villains. Really I didn&#8217;t care whether any of them lived or died. The Amazons know how to fight and we didn&#8217;t even get to experience the battle. Rip off.Villain Scale: 5Layel and Delilah made an appearance. They were just so cute together and they have a baby on the way! YAY!Character Scale: 7This novella was a huge letdown for me. I feel like if this was an actual novel it would&#8217;ve been so much better. The characters lacked their usual umph, the Amazons were terribly developed, and the romance wasn&#8217;t as heart stopping as it was last time. It also really bothered me how Nola went from loving her sisters to hating them all because of Zane. Then again she didn&#8217;t really like them all that much previously, but the change was still really fast.

What is new is that Spirit animals need to bond with humans to help form a new community.  It is the hope that with the instincts of animals and the guidance of these animals the new humanity would not kill each other.The characters needed to be developed more.  Elysia was so interesting, I felt as if she was held back by the author's writing rather than being enhanced by it.  Darien was just normal and really had no depth either.

While I found myself enraptured in this world, I wasn&#8217;t all that crazy about the two main characters.

It was but a taste of what was to come, to allow readers to determine if this series would be for them.  While we do not learn enough about Elysia and Darien to make a deep connection to them, we do make some connection, enough to push us on to read the trilogy.I personally am not a huge fan of post apocalyptic literature, so for me, that was where more of the problem with the book lies.  Similarly, the whole animal spirit aspect does not particularly interest me.  I think people who are very interested in Native American religion and philosophy will be quite interested in this book, but for me, a person begin guided by a squirrel is more than a little corny.That being said, I do think the novella was well written, and worth reading.

This story has strong characters who bring interesting plots to the storylines with issues such as homelessness, sexual abuse, rape, torture, special abilities and paranormal; a story that is so unpredictable.This is a book/storyline where you need and open mind, this is not an easy read.  You need to go back few pages in order to catch the idea, the meaning of what you just read.  Even if the storyline is about Jesse and Sarah who are about 17 years old, this is adult material.

3615,B001VNCPJY,"[0, 0]",4,"This book has elements of just about everything in it.  It started off as realistic fiction.  Girl meets boy, who somehow ends up staying with the girl's family.  But added to that is that the boy, Jesse, has flashbacks about his past, and visions of a boy he has never met, while having conversations with something that could be a computer.  And, if that isn't enough, he also has fire-starting and healing powers.It is quite well-written, even with the confusion of so many genres appearing in the same book.  It was also highly entertaining, mostly because you never knew what was going to happen next.  I couldn't stop reading it, mainly because I kept having to decipher just what was happening.As I read on, I could understand the title of this book.  In some ways, Jesse was a ghost.  Someone who was there, but who wasn't who he thought he was.  I really liked his vulnerability.  He held a lot of guilt over his past and a belief that he was better off alone.  He also had to live with the gifts he had been given - even if he considered some of them a curse.  He's also trying to find out who he is.  What teenager doesn't ask themselves at one time who they are?  I know I did.  And that's what draws me to this book - the underlying realism to it - even when it's anything, but that.Some of the scenes written are very intense and I wonder if L. Lee Lowe wrote purely for fun or if there was some hidden meaning behind the writing.  In one scene, the one with the man hanging from the tree, it felt almost spiritual to me.  As if Jesse had to put something to rest before he could move on.  Like letting go of his past so he could live the life he should be living and not the one he was.  And, I know it may only be me reading into it, but it reminds me of Shakespeare's 'As you like it' - 'All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players...'  In some ways that's how it feels.  It's like Jesse is a puppet with someone else pulling the strings, especially with Red and the others.Sarah, another character, is what held Jesse together.  She's the one who gives him hope.  She goes through a similar hell to Jesse and yet at the same time different.  In some ways, she's also his downfall or at least the guys she hung around with were. There are other characters I adore as well, like Sarah's dad, Finn.  He gave Jesse support when he needed it and was there for him when no other male figure was.This whole novel was complicated, gave me hope of a happy ending for the characters, and was bittersweet.  I can't go to much into why it's bittersweet because it would contain spoilers.  I didn't consider the book a light read, well, it was a light read at the start and evolved from there.  To be honest, some of it I didn't understand at all, mainly because, as I mentioned earlier, there was more than one or two genres in it.  But even so, it didn't stop me from liking it.  The book is also longer than most, so it will take more time to read.I think this book is best suited to someone who prefers a challenging book, because that's how I found it.And now, since I don't have anything more to add, here is my rating :- four out of five stars.","09 9, 2012",A134TCTK1FZF2V,Sandy @ Craving YA Reads,Book Review from Sandy at Magical Manuscipts,1347148800

From the clumsy dialog to the sloppy plot line to the incredibly bad writing this book was a failure.  For example, there is a point at which the protagonist is helping someone up.  The prose reads something like ""Jonathan reached out his hand and Jonathan took it.""  I am not kidding.  Now, that may be slightly paraphrased, but the essentials are there.  For example, there is a battle in an office building where the police are getting absolutely creamed.  Do they stop and regroup?  Does anybody say ""these tactics are not working?""  Nope.  They continue fighting using the old methods until practically everyone is dead.These same mistakes are made over and over and over again in this novel.  I will say that those few snippets about the Christian Faith that Mr. Somers shared were pretty spot on, even if clumsily delivered, but that's about as far as I am willing to go to provide praise for this book.  If you are bored silly, and for some reason absolutely nothing else is available and if you can get this book for free, then go ahead and read it.  Otherwise spend your money on something else.  C. S. Lewis' space trilogy is a better choice, or perhaps Kathy Tyers' Firebird trilogy if you can find it.

3679,B001XURN06,"[17, 19]",5,"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic ""The Forsyte Saga,"" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.  Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to ""own"" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than ""property.""The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English ""Age of Innocence."" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (""Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl"") and lushly written descriptives (""... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago"").As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to ""own"" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the ""Forsye Saga,"" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels.","03 25, 2010",A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E.

3681,B001XURN06,"[45, 48]",5,"John Galsworthy (1867-1933) was a very popular writer at the turn of the 20th Century.  He was the son of a wealthy lawyer and studied law at Oxford. He became a solicitor in 1890 but never practiced law.  Instead he used his father's wealth to travel and learn about writing fiction from talented authors including Joseph Conrad.In the Forsyte Chronicles, Galsworthy created the history of an extended family that begins in the Victorian era in Britain in the early 1800s, extends through the Eduardian Era in the latter decades of the 1800s, and ends after World War I during the British social and economic turmoil of the 1920s.The Chronicles, now called the Forsyte Saga, is a trilogy of novels: The Man Of Property (1906), In Chancery (1920), and To Let (1921).  The fist in the series sets the stage with wealth earned through the driving motivation of land ownership by the founding fathers of the Forsyte family.  The actors on the stage have landed riches and establish social networks as cohesive as the royal family in England.  Even their relationships are governed by the limits of ownership.  Women are the property of their husbands and accept their roles with the reward of financial security.In Chancery describes the continued accumulation of wealth of the family obtained through careful management of money increasingly independent of private property. There is an unwritten family rule of 4% return on all investments. Social conventions begin to change in the story with the problems brought on by allowing outsiders into the family's closed system through marriages. The women become somewhat rebellious refusing to accept many of the subservient roles that were accepted in the early generation Forsytes.To Let traces the family's fortunes through the turn of the 20th Century as the newer generations begin to consume rather than generate family wealth. This is a time of social and legal conflicts for the family that disrupt the order of their traditional lives.  The focus gradually changes to the youngest members of the family who, because of the devastating effects of the World War, believe that there is more to life than hoarding of riches, commodities that can disappear quickly.  These Forsytes pursue artistic and social justice activities and use the family money to go their own ways. The 4% rule is not forgotten, but rather never known by the youngsters.I first read the Forsyte Chronicles paperbacks in the early 1970s as a young man just out of the U. S. Army after the Vietnam War.  I enjoyed reading and experiencing the stability of the family and social structure of British society in the novels, a real contrast to my life then in California.  I identified with the last generations of Forsytes in To Let, focusing on their individual self actualizing choices.After rereading the trilogy on my Kindle1, I now identify with the more conservative earlier generations of Forsytes described in The Man of Property and In Chancery. I appreciated the change of perspective as I approach retirement, and I gained insight through a life review by proxy. I can relate the work to other great generational novels depicting the turn of the 20th Century, such as Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks.The world is much more interactive now than it was in the Forsyte's mystical Great Britain, and social stress has taken on global proportions.  But the activities of making a living, maintaining family stability, and attempting to reach personal satisfaction remain great themes for the turn of the 21st Century.  I highly recommend the Forsyte saga to readers (especially Kindle readers) who will see that the endless cycles of social life continue and personal development is a product of these social rhythms.","01 28, 2010",A2KJZXIXBHVG0K,Gary Severance,Possession and Obsession,1264636800

To spite his parents he chooses the worst-sounding camp possible, but will his rash action come back to bite him?""Night Camp"" is a book probably aimed towards 9 - 12 year olds and would make a good reader for boys in particular. Shane and his cousin Brad end up in a camp where all the activities are at night and the campers sleep during the day. The tabloid-wielding Brad becomes convinced that camp leaders, Colin and Trevor are actually vampires and in convincing Shane, commences an investigation to find proof and a way out of what has now become a very dangerous camp experience.This story was a lot of fun and written well for the target age group. The simplicity in style didn't blunt the intrigue at all and I found myself eagerly anticipating how the author was going to resolve the mystery. Additionally, you did get some insight into Shane as a main character: his reactions to feelings of abandonment, his discomfort around girls and his growing unease about the decisions he was making.Young children do like to get a bit of a scare and I think this book delivers without becoming too sinister or alternatively, too watered down. I think the younger set will get a kick out of it. There may even be a lesson or two in there, but I didn't feel like I was being bludgeoned to death with them which is always appreciated.Is it for adults? It clearly isn't the target audience, but I certainly didn't resent the experience, so I think adults could enjoy it. There are many moments of embarrassment felt by the characters which might seem a little silly to an adult, but I think the author has done a good job writing from a child's point of view. If the reader can appreciate the story from that same point of view I believe it loses that silliness.I don't read children's fiction often, but this was a fun visit. I hope this story can make its way into the hands of children so that they can experience the anticipation, creepiness and overall enjoyment of reading ""Night Camp"".","01 24, 2012",AERQG2VDOIQ54,"Caleb Blake ""Caleb Blake""",What's the mystery behind Night Camp?,1327363200
3685,B001YQF0OK,"[0, 0]",4,"(cross posted from the blog Wading Through Electronic Ink)In Night Camp, Shane's parents are forcing him to go to summer camp, and in retaliation, he insists upon going to the strangest camp he can find - Night Camp, where campers sleep all day and explore the world at night. But soon after their arrival, Shane, his cousin Brad, and fellow camper Nicole begin to suspect that the people running the camp might be vampires.Overall I found Night Camp to be a cute and engaging story about the adventures of kids at a summer camp. It brought back lots of memories of my times at summer camp, and I found myself wishing that I too could have spent my summers living in a castle and exploring caves instead of the much more traditional cabins and canoeing that I remember. Of course, I was also grateful that I was not entirely cut off from adults and the outside world while at the mercy of people who I suspected might want to use my blood as a midnight snack.Night Camp was written for a younger audience than what I usually review, and I sometimes had a difficult time putting myself in the mindset of a younger child. If I were to encounter a vampire, I would immediately try to determine which of the many vampire mythologies in fiction most closely resembled the creatures with which I was presented. But clearly the average 13-year-old does not have the experience or analytic capability to try to understand vampires on this level. To him, a vampire is simply a blood-sucking monster, though whether such an assumption is fair is the whole point of the book.While I don't know that I would recommend Night Camp to my usual audience, it is definitely the kind of thing that might appeal to the ten-year-old in your life.","01 24, 2012",A2HWU1VTCT8CXM,"Elizabeth Corrigan ""formerly Wading Through E...",Cute Tween Tale of Terror,1327363200

I read the first few pages and thought I might might want to put it away, until I realized I was reading satire and a self-help book all-in-one.The book follows Beauty on her quest to turn her human, but sadly lacking husband back into the Beast who had won her heart before her marriage. Along the way, she meets other women who featured prominently in the Grimm Fairy Tales and listens to their tales of what happened Happily Ever After. Just like Anita Baker sang more than 20 years ago, fairy tales don't come true.Like many a woman who married because it was expected of her, or it was her duty, or she thought she could ""change"" him, these ladies share their stories of what went wrong, and finally, about what has made them happy.Along the way Beauty learns and grows, and like every good fairy tale, there is a moral to the story: instead of trying to change everyone around her and her circumstances to become what she wants, Beauty does the only possible thing she can do to make herself happy: she becomes what she needs instead of relying on somebody else to do it for her. It was a glorious end, and finally does credence to the line ""fairy tales can come true"".","04 20, 2012",A1SPR01CXDWGRZ,Laurie Davis,Become your own desires,1334880000

3726,B0020BUX0Y,"[0, 0]",4,"Relentless is the 5th of a series of six books by Jack Campbell that collectively tell the story of Captain John Geary and his command of the space fleet which belongs to an Alliance of worlds occupied by humans.  The  books in series order are: 1) The Lost Fleet: Dauntless, 2) The Lost Fleet: Fearless, 3) The Lost Fleet: Courageous, 4) The Lost Fleet: Valiant, 5) The Lost Fleet: Restless, and 6) The Lost Fleet: Victorious.The Alliance has been in a state of war for 100 years with another group of human worlds called the Syndicated Worlds, or Syndics for short.  John Geary was thought to have been killed in the early opening attacks of that war.  In reality, he escaped certain doom in a survival pod launched from his Heavy Cruiser.  He was placed in a state of hibernation, with the expectation that he would be picked up in a few weeks, but something went wrong.  The emergency beacon on his pod failed, and he drifted until he was accidentally found 100 years later by another Alliance Battle Cruiser.He was revived and found himself thrust into command of the entire Alliance Fleet (which was lost deep behind enemy lines) and expected to miraculously get the Fleet home safely and to put and end to the war once and for all, and he was to do this against the overwhelming forces of the Syndicate Worlds.Compounding his problems is the fact that he must deal with a group of rebellious officers among his own crew, a love relationship that can not be acknowledged, politicians at home who want to arrest him when he gets there for a crime he has not committed and for which there is no evidence to suggest that he ever thought of committing it.  And if that were not enough, he also has to deal with an unknown enemy with unknown technological capabilities that is known to exist just beyond the border that marks the extreme edge of Syndic space.If you like SciFi that's filled with space battles based on reasonably thought out tactical plans and strategies, this series may be for you.  It is much closer to reality than the Lensman series, though I will not say that is a better or worse story line.  That is for the reader to decide.","09 7, 2010",AWYOWZKRBKQHQ,Mary Ellison,Relentless,1283817600

After 4 books of tactical genius and reasoned risks, Captain Geary and the Alliance Fleet are within a handful of jumps to Alliance space.  Captain Geary struggles as the risks seem more tangible as their final destination seems so close.  Fleet opponents become more desperate as they realize that there is little time to displace Captain Geary.  The Syndics are not content to be counted out and still have some cards to play on the seemingly invincible Alliance fleet.  Many plot lines come to epic conclusion in this book which I find has the best ending of any of the books in the original Lost Fleet series.Each book builds on the previous so it is important to read the books in order.  The first Lost Fleet Series consists ofThe Lost Fleet: Dauntless,The Lost Fleet: Fearless,The Lost Fleet: Courageous,The Lost Fleet: Valiant,The Lost Fleet: RelentlessandThe Lost Fleet: Victorious.

I'll admit right now that I'm not a big fan of hitman novels, but the character of hitman Frank Jolino was so finely drawn that I was hooked within the first few pages.I'd love to see Jolino in other books because he was intelligent, articulate, droll, and at ease in his own skin. He also surprised me because he had a moral compass. Add all that to the fact that he was a vintage mystery reader, and you get a guy who is complex, appealing, and likable. Oh, yeah, he kills people for a living, but they're by no means innocents undeserving of being whacked, but Merz lets the reader draw that conclusion. He doesn't state the obvious and then hammer it home.Less likable is Ernst Stahl, once an idealist radical and now a jaded assassin, despite constant reminders from Stahl's character that he was completing a job only to save his son. His moral compass is stuck on ""anything goes in the name of paternal love.""When the two end up in some odd paranormal mutual awareness of each other, it's interesting albeit rather unbelievable, but the compelling character of Frank Jolino keeps the reader turning the pages. You probably won't suspend disbelief, but you'll be compelled to keep reading. You'll also be rooting for Frank to figure a way out of the mess and to, somehow, end up with the babe who has some surprises of her own.WarningI downloaded the book in February, and there are numerous ""glitches"" in the book.

This was an awesome thriller with lots of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I love stories that take me off guard and deal with complex characters that don't seem as if they're who they are, only to turn your expectations of them right on the side.The story deals with Frank Jolino and Ernst ""Stahl"", two expert assassins living on opposite sides of the globe in different lives until one fateful moment of mental interlinking brings them together. Soon each is allowed to view the other's experience as if they were perched on the other's shoulder. Their lives interconnect from jobs to love lives and betrayal while each have something in the balance. With Stahl, his son's life is at stake on the condition that he kills a scientist connected with the SARS disease. With Frank, he is sent to kill his old girlfriend, the long lost niece of his mafia boss who he still is in love with, on suspicion that she is connected with the feds.This was one novel that was hard to put down.

Overall, my nose was in the pages all the way to the very satisfying end.This is a late entry for the best of my 2009 reads and it goes right at the top.

I feel she sets a wonderful example for all young girls. She proves that you can do anything you want, no matter the opposition.This is a good story at heart, and it has some memorable characters. It was presented to me as fantasy, but it is lacking in that department. There is some minor magic which appears about two-thirds of the way through, and I would have liked to have had that throughout the story. Perhaps it is more prevalent in future installments of the series. Aislinn does have visions to communicate with her deceased brother, which introduces a paranormal aspect. For me, this story falls more under historical fiction than fantasy. Romance came into play at the end, and it was nice to see a man who preferred a strong woman over a typical obedient wife.I was quite surprised to see her riding out after bandits at the young age of 9-10. That seems far too young, even for the boys who are training alongside her. I doubt any child would be required to do such a thing until they were closer to 14-15 years old, even in 1155 CE. A typical girl of her era would have been too small to go around slashing at bandits.There are a few wrong word errors in this book, and it could benefit from a professional proofreader.

I never fully got a sense that Aislinn&#8217;s hardships and troubles on her path to becoming a knight was anything more than minor irritants. The scene, of the young pages going on a bandit raid, stretched the bounds of credulity. The love story had all the usual twists of two people who eventually manage to marry.A side plot which was started, was left hanging. I can only hope it is further explained in later books. Half-way through the book, the would be lady knight starts to have visions of her brother, whereby it seems the author is trying to bring a stronger religious presence into the novel. She also attempts to add an element of magic, another bit that also doesn&#8217;t go very far.

Nothing came of that at all...)I really enjoyed it, especially reading about a young girl learning to be a knight, but there were a lot of typos for a published book and a lot of things were left unexplained (There is a sequel tho). Also, Aislinn's dead brother showing up and talking about knights in Heaven was weird.Otherwise, great book, well written, and about a strong female character.","07 30, 2010",A3THYM7XMB8B0U,Lola's Mom,"Kinda YA, but Good",1280448000

And this one has a fantasy twist that makes it that much more fun. Reading about knights and castles are always enjoyable novels for me. Bottom line...Woman of Honor is a well-told, emotionally gripping story. I was literally swept away into the battle scenes, the romance, the fierce loyalty and honor even if it went against matters of the heart. I nearly cried several times while reading this story and was so engrossed a bomb could have gone off outside and I would've kept reading. I am eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. And anyone who has a computer can read this book. While it may not be a print book yet and can only be read in e-book format, it's well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. My heart is still pounding. And don't let that sweet rating fool you. There was some serious passion in this novel, but if you were to compare it to most romances I guess it was sweet since the characters honored each other's purity. But it still sizzled. And talk about an ending that leaves you begging for more. Sheesh! But it was more than satisfying.

3754,B0021L9YDK,"[1, 2]",4,"This is a sweet story covering the challenges facing a girl's unique journey to knighthood...and more. The book covers Aislinn's years from 1155 to 1169 AD.Aislinn is a determined young girl of 8 when she seeks permission to train to become a lady knight. The King agrees to a probational two year period and her work and struggles against prejudice begins. The King allows another young girl, a street ""rat"" to train too. Instead of helping each other the girls are jealous and distrustful. Unlike the other outgoing girl, Aislinn, who has some reading and math skills already, has few friends among the boys.  She is lucky to get Geoffrey, a friend of Caelan, as a mentor and Prince Caelan himself as a silent watcher/companion.As the pages grow to squires they grow closer together and Aislinn finds others to help her with the areas that she needs help with. The ""brain"" helps her with math. The stable master tries to help her when she is assigned a beautiful horse who just won't respond to the reins. She figures out that she needs to start from scratch to train Dream Rider without saddle trappings and finally she makes head way.  Aislinn even takes secret weapon training from a mysterious Shadow Warrior, Ryu.  These warriors are not trusted by either Arnhems or Speicans and had something to do with the war between the two nations.Slowly the other pages and teachers learn to respect Aislinn for her unyielding determination in tackling her challenges.  Aislinn struggles with her emotions as well as her mental and physical training. As she matures she also has to struggle with conflicting desires between her dream to be a lady knight and her growing feelings and friendship with Prince Caelan who is destined to be married for political and royal position.Prince Caelan is quiet and intense. It is clear he likes Aislinn from the beginning even if they seem to quarrel and set each other on edge. He admires her and tries to help when her stubbornness will let her accept help. But he is the Prince and is well trained to understand his duties which will include marriage as arranged by his parents. He struggles with his clear feelings for Aislinn which conflict with the duty to his position.This book is the author's debut novel. Although I feel the writing could use a little more depth, which I think will come with experience, the story concept, plot and action are sound. Also the book seemed well researched offering some interesting insight in the life of pages and squires. It is an easy going story with sweet primary characters, harsh villains, plenty of action, emotional stress, dangerous enemies, battles and magical mysteries. At the end of the book there are still open questions to be further explored in the next story in the series which I am confidant will be another lovely read.","08 29, 2011",ANM42D7WGZY83,"MSEreads ""mesreads""",Woman of Honor,1314576000

This is the first novel in ""The Kingdom of Arnhem Books"" and it's a thrilling introduction to Zoltack's world.The novel opens with seven-year-old Aislinn of Barbhe leaving her home and seeking out the king. She wants to ask him for permission to become a Lady Knight. Surprisingly, he grants it.Aislinn's closest friends are Caelan and Geoffrey. As they enter puberty, they are challenged their changing bodies and their classes. Geoffrey develops a crush on Aislinn.Aislinn barely has any time to notice. She's training with a shadow warrior, Ryu, learning new fighting skills. She also makes the acquaintance of a griffin, Alce. Eventually Ryu leaves, and Aislinn has dreams of him being tortured. With Caelan and Geoffrey's help, the trio save Ryu, but not before angering the king.Aislinn has to deal with her growing feelings for the Crown Prince. After a tender kiss, both Aislinn and Caelan realize they are falling in love with each other. It's an impossible position for both - especially when the king announces Caelan's engagement to a foreign princess. How can Caelan give his heart to another woman when it's Aislinn he wants? The situation tests both. Will love win in the end?Zoltack's writing is creative and full of adventure. There's never a dull moment in Aislinn's life. The dialogue is authentic to the time and the plot moves at a brisk pace.The characters are rich and vivid. Aislinn has a challenging task to balance; her heart's desire of becoming a Lady Knight while staying true to the woman in her. In that regard, Zoltack finds the perfect mix, showing Aislinn as a lady attending a ball and showing her in the heat of battle.  Aislinn's struggle to be accepted is one many readers can connect with.Caelan is also a character full of complexies. He's torn between his duty and heart, not an easy place to be. His admiration of Aislinn is subtle at first, and when he reveals his feelings to her, it's very rewarding to the reader. Caelan's nobility shines despite all the challenges he faces.Zoltack's story is ""sweet"" for romance readers with several sensual kisses and caresses.

More simply, the author introduced multiple generations into the crime scenario so that neither the reader nor the hero was ever particularly clear as to just what the point was. If there was a point. There is a difference between complexity and confusion; the book reflects the latter far more than the former. There is also a problem, never resolved: linking the multiple murders and cases of mayhem, with a single thread as the denouement seeks to do. It never really gels in literary terms nor in terms of a satisfying conclusion.The book does have its virtues in the development of some of its characters and their traits, as well as in the creation of a sense of the confusion the only solution to which requires that the hero keep plugging along through a fog of deceit.Overall, not a book I can unconditionally recommend or condemn. I would not put myself into a situation in which this was the only thing I had to read with more than a few hours of journey ahead.

He had grown up in the four corners area and in the service had done intelligence work, he is retired and is now a high school math teacher on his way to teaching summer classes after dropping his daughter off.A niece calls while he is traveling and begs for help, her husband is hiding in the desert accused of a murder he says he did not commit and she wants Dan to investigate.  He did not think a lot of her husband and going ""home"" brought back memories.  His parents had disappeared mysteriously many years ago and his older brother was killed in an auto accident about 18 years ago.He can defend himself, but this is not an action adventure hero who mops up the bad guys with a flurry of kicks and shot gun blasts. He stays in shape but is not a combat robot, he thinks and analyses and follows clues and once engaged is very persistent.  He pulls the threads of a tangled web spun by a loose conspiracy of men who have and seek power and riches above all, letting no one (least of all family) get in their way.

This area, filled with mysteries about the Ancient People is abundantly rich, with day to day real life struggles liberally sprinkled in.A myriad of thoughts torment the character's minds and the author cleverly burns nagging details into their psyches, details that refuse to leave.This is a beguiling mystery that turns a bit wild, stressing the protagonist, Daniel Corbin, just enough to gloss over his underlying paranoia.The reader can easily get enmeshed in local history, or enjoy being introduced to varied native tribal information.Black always presents well plotted tales that move at a good pace. And, Daniel Corbin proves to be a believable investigator.Many years ago, I too was attracted to test haunting mystic of The Ancient Ones, the Pueblo Indians and The Cliff Dwellers.

I am not a big fan of the novella form- characters are usually one dimensional, stories seem rushed or overly simplistic and a little bit of background can read as dry as a law review when you are anxious to get back to the story. So I went into this expecting that. In the end, I found it didn't manage to avoid falling into those pitfalls, but I found I was pleased to have been introduced to the mythology of this world.This one was a little bit better than many novellas- the imagery is beautiful. Anyone who has spent time in a jungle would appreciate it. Very magical setting.The characters were not developed at all- I barely managed to put together a mental image of what they might look like, but the sex was hot and their attraction was palpable. Maggie and Brandt were likable enough, though you had to work hard to overlook his blatant deception that set off the whole thing. For the sake of the novella form, a reasonable back and forth between the two that would have allowed the relationship to develop had to be sacrificed. In places the passion short circuited rational thought, but Ms. Feehan managed to maintain the integrity of both characters.The best part of this, as I mentioned, was the mythology. Ms. Feehan has created a wonderful concept here. The environmental message was laid on a little thick, but overall it was a good concept to quickly win the heart of the reader.Anyone who is familiar with Ms. Feehan's work will recognize this isn't her best work, but it is a fast read that opens a door to a series that has great potential for passion.","09 5, 2010",AQNXEOJ4RPCGW,A.

There is a core group of friends who went to Eton together and raised a lot of hell together, but then became each other's family of choice after some lost wives and children, some were crippled by war, some were disowned by family of birth for being too radical, etc... The group has changed and added on during the years, each man adding a few choice members, but the core group remains. Each book is about a specific member or adventure of the group, so it could be considered a stand alone, but as you get into the higher number books, it becomes more difficult to follow the story without knowing the supporting characters from that core group of family/friends.This book is about Ashkoda Paignton, a half Indian/half British doctor whom we first met when he was suffering from a debilitating disease and was only a teenager. His mother's use of Indian Ayurvedic medicine helped heal one of the Rakehells in the"" Model Master"". Since then, she met and married another of the group and had two children with him, making Ash the step son of one of the Rakehells.Returning home from London to join a medical practice, Ash comes upon a young woman he is acquainted with being mauled and assaulted in the woods. He rescues her, takes her to his home for his mother to examine and gets to know her better, finding out that her sister set her up on that disastrous"" carriage ride"" from which he rescued her.From the time Ellen is rescued by Ash, she's fascinated by his happy family, (his stepfather is her cousin), his political, spiritual and healing beliefs and his gentleness with her. She learns so much from his mother to help care for her own, who had a stroke. Ellen loves to hear about Indian culture and religion. But mostly, she's fascinated with Ash. He's the largest but most handsome man she's ever seen and even though she's normally nervous around men, Ash makes her feel so wonderful.Ellen has no qualms or problems merging Indian culture with British. In fact, learning about tantric practices sounds downright wonderful. But any time two cultures meet, someone's going to be upset, now just to figure out who's spreading nasty rumors before their relationship is tainted with some one else's lies.Heat factor hot.","09 7, 2013",A7AO0PBCKSW82,Cindy DeGraaff,Interesting addition to the series,1378512000

What?!  Believing that he was out of his mind, Dallas was determined to escape this crazy, sexy man and get back home before her step-aunt and step-cousin could get their greedy hands on her riches.I found Overboard to be a hilarious, passionate story.  From the start Thane and Dallas butted heads and squabbled over everything.  While Thane believed that his words were a commandment; Dallas refused to readily comply with them.  She quickly expressed her disagreements and firmly stood toe-to-toe with Thane.  The only way the couple could settle any of their disputes was in a sexual interlude.  As you can imagine the sex was lustfully hot and full of passion.

3899,B00264H2VI,"[5, 6]",5,"Plot/Storyline: 5 StarsWhen I was a kid, I had a book called ""One Minute Mysteries"" that I loved. It had short mysteries that had clues in them. At the end of each one, the detective would state that he had solved the crime, then the book would ask something like, ""How did he know?"" The reader could try to figure it out, then turn the page for the answer. There are four stories in this format included in this collection. I have to admit that I was only able to 'solve' two of them.  This author showed tremendous talent in his ability to weave intelligent mysteries.Being a fan of his Jack Daniels mysteries, I especially enjoyed the stories featuring her, her partner, and Phineas Trout. However, you do not have to have read any of those books to enjoy the stories.There is also a `horror' section with some truly gruesome tales. The themes in this part include vampires, zombies, aliens, abortion, ghosts, etc. This collection is not for the weak-stomached or the easily offended.The `humor' section at the end has a few essays/stories that are aimed more at authors, but they were still very funny.  I also loved the one about James Bond's toys. There was another one that still has me wondering how you can kill someone with fabric softener.Every single story in this collection has an original and interesting plot. The humor injected into even the most disturbing scenario made for enjoyable reads throughout.Character Development: 5 StarsThe characters in each of these tales were developed to the extent necessary for the reader's enjoyment. There weren't any actual character study types as these were mainly plot and story driven works.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe writing style was exactly what I have come to expect from Mr. Konrath. Not only is his prose concise and well-structured, but he has truly mastered the art of the short story.Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 StarsThe editing and formatting were of mostly professional quality.Rating: NC-17 for Graphic Violence, Rape, Necrophilia, Pedophilia, and any other `ilia' you can probably think of. In other words, this is a VERY graphic collection.","10 19, 2009",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,Proof of Brilliance,1255910400

So its fair to say that he's a safe bet and keeps the hits rolling.In reality, some of these stories are sold as stand-alone ebooks. But you&#8217;re really getting  10 eBooks for the price of one. If that isn&#8217;t more bang for your buck, I don&#8217;t know what is.But I&#8217;d have to say that 65 proof is not only a good introduction to this author, but you&#8217;re also getting many genres across the board and you&#8217;re saving money by buying this book.This massive ebook collection is separated into 4 parts: Jack and Friends (any stories related to his mystery thriller series starring heroine, Jacqueline Daniels), Crime stories, Horror stories and Funny stuff.You&#8217;re led through these stories, and through his publishing career, as the author himself gives a brief intro to each story. Once you become familiar with his wit, it turns into a major selling point for each story. I&#8217;d sometimes laugh as he jokes in between them as he sets up the next tale. He&#8217;s also really good with Flash Fiction (stories in 500 words or less).Right off the bat, we&#8217;re treated with some clever Locked Room mysteries which I wasn&#8217;t a fan of before reading this book. But he came up with some really clever stuff. My favorite stories had to be the ones with Phineas Troutt, a hard-boiled dying man who generally doesn&#8217;t care about ruffling feathers or dishing out some old-fashioned justice. He has a gritty attitude that draws you in.The crime stories were equally hard-boiled as well as equally unpredictable. The Agreement story was especially chilling.The Horror section was good. One story stands out the most and that is The Screaming. It&#8217;s the most original concept for a vampire story I have read yet. It was also written a different way. I liked the style of it.Another good one is Symbios. This Sci-fi horror kind of reminded me of Stephen King&#8217;s Survivor Type story but with a compelling stranded on an alien planet angle.All told, I haven&#8217;t finished every single story. I&#8217;m 90% finished with it. But I know that it is a majorly meaty collection of stories which will intrigue you, wow you, shock you, drop you, sock you and keep you reading all night.There&#8217;s something for everyone.","02 20, 2013",A13QI2V4TQWQ5J,Roberto Scarlato,65 Proof: It Packs A Punch!,1361318400

And in Book 3 she is injured trying saving Sheri, the fount of all Blonde jokes, and finds her Mate while healing.- As the fourth book in the series, ""Steel Beauty"" picks up as Book 3 concludes, with Rick wanting to take Belle home. The book proper begins in February, three months of PT later, and as she heads off to the Poconos to join her Mate and his Pack.- Includes excerpts fromForsaken Talismanby Ashleigh Raine,Called by Bloodby Evie Byrne, andVery Much Aliveby Dana Marie Bell.- There are two ""free read""s available on the author's website giving us a little epilogue of Rick and Belle - ""Little Red"" and ""'Twas a Coyote Christmas"".- The Poconos Pack have their own series. First bookFinding Forgivenessis m/m and tells the story of Ben Malone (Marshall) and Dave Maldonado (Beta).Opinion:Another good, solid story in Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series, linking the Pumas with her new series on the Poconos Pack. It's certainly interesting and opens a whole new avenue of shifter romances. Tossing in some telepathy and a holiday resort, it should make a good new series.As far as ""Steel Beauty"" goes, it's a nice romance. Belle proves herself to be everything a Luna should be - strong, caring, intelligent - and Rick is a lovely Dominant Alpha with a loving streak. It is an easy paranormal romance with explicit bedroom scenes and a HEA. It fits well into the series.""Little Red"":When Rick finds the costume Belle left him for the Halloween party, he's just about ready to kill her. But when he saw her, and the additional goodies, he knew this would be a very memorable party.A little story emphasising the joy in Bell's stories, especially once we have our HEA with caring, happy, respectful, loving h and H. It's sweet, erotic, and very original. Definitely worth a look.""'Twas a Coyote Christmas"":Rick tells Belle a Christmas story to ease her pain.Sometimes an author just wants to pop in on her characters and give her readers a little smile - and that's exactly what this is.

3934,B0026OQYYO,"[7, 9]",5,"Belinda `Belle' Campbell has had more than her fair share of pain - both mentally and physically.  She's been practically ostracized by many of the members of the Halle pride and injured severely enough to require a steel pin in her leg - which means that she can't shapeshift until they're removed.  The last thing she needs is more complications but that's exactly what she gets in the form of an Alpha wolf named Rick Lowell.Rick Lowell is the Alpha of the Red Wolf Poconos Pack.  He isn't exactly having an easy go of things here lately.  He's been shot, killed a rogue, found his mate, learned of her injuries, and now been told that he cannot take her home.  Why? Because she's Puma and the Wolf pack has to be prepared to accept a non-Wolf Luna.  He could handle all that but throw in an uppity dominant female looking to take over as Luna and things are bound to get very interesting.Belle has no doubt that Rick is her mate but she's not a push over and he's a little too full of himself for her taste.  Besides her doctors are in Halle and therefore she'll be staying put for the time being - possibly until the pin in her leg can be removed.  Rick's not willing to wait that long though, once the cast comes off he wants her with him - and it will still be another six months before she'll be able to shift.Belle's all for starting her life at Rick's side but she's not at all ready to take on Gina and her demands for full protocol.  Fortunately Belle isn't afraid to fight for what's hers and if that means taking on one conniving bitch then she'll use every means at her disposal to ensure that she comes out on top.  Rick is aware of just how devious Gina is and he's willing to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that Belle's transition into the pack is as smooth as possible and that she be allowed to recuperate before facing Gina and her challenge.  He shouldn't have worried.  Even being unable to shift, Belle is more than capable of facing down Gina and she does it with such style that you'll be left with no doubt that this `cat' is far superior to the `dog.'  Belle's the perfect match for Rick, but what will happen when Gina's plans push Rick and Belle into making decisions that could have disastrous results?Just when I thought the HALLE PUMA series couldn't get any better, it does!  STEEL BEAUTY is the fourth book in this delightful series and revisiting these characters is a pleasure you won't want to pass up.  This story is infused with humor, some real kick butt action, a memorable romance and proof that cats and dogs can be friends - and so much more. Belle won me over with her `in your face' attitude and the hilarious way she taunts Gina - as well as Rick.  She's not a gal who's going to let anyone get away with anything and I adore that about her.  Rick is exactly the sort of man Belle needs, he's just got to learn to share problems and worries - and she is chock full of ways of ensuring that he doesn't forget that she is his life partner.If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.

Belle's injury is repaired by putting pins in her legs, while the pins are there she cannot shift.Belle also has a problem with her pride the Halle pumas, because she was best friends with a puma who was outcast (see Sweet Dreams) the rest of the pride think she had something to do with an attack on the Beta's mate. Belle has proved her worth to the pride leaders but she has lost her job and most of her friends because of the feelings of others. After her injury she meets the Alpha leader of the Poconos Wolf Pack, when he came down to help with the attack on Sheri. Rick Lowell the Wolf pack alpha wants to take her back to the Poconos and care for her but is persauded to leave Belle in Halle to continue her therapy and care by the shifter specialist there. When she recovers more he sends several of his wolf leaders to escort her to the wolf lodge in the Poconos.Belle is challenged and taunted by Gena the acting leader of the women in the wolf pack. Gena's goal is to be the Luna of the pack and she definitely won't step down for a puma who is also crippled! Of course she's never met Belle!Although there is a serious side to his story, Belle and Rick's romance is the center of the plot and I loved it!

Start with one sexy Alpha male who is anxious to claim his mate. Add his chosen mate, who just happens to be a Puma. Into the mix add one bitch with the desire to take the mates place as pack Luna, and stir in humor, action and some very spicy bedroom action. Garnish with politics and pack protocol, and you have one fantastic book.Steel Beauty is the fourth of Dana Marie Bell's Halle Puma stories, and it is a fun book to read. There are places where I laughed out loud. The heroine, Belinda ""Belle"" Campbell has to face several hardships in the beginning of this book. The steps Belle takes once she gets to the Pack lodge to take her place as Luna are hilarious. The passage at the beginning of the book, with Belle and Rick texting each other is an imaginative use of technology and a great piece of comic relief. Belle continues to handle things with grace, humor and just a little bit of underhandedness. Do Belle and Rick get their happily ever after? Will Rick ever get the air horn away from Belle? Pick up a copy of Steel Beauty to find those answers.Dana Marie Bell writes such believable characters, and I became lost in the world of the Poconos Wolves and the Halle Pumas. I wonder if anyone else would have dared to pair an Alpha wolf and a Puma as life mates. I enjoyed the banter between Belle and Rick, and there were places she made me laugh out loud at the antics Belle got up to in order to thwart Gina over and over. I also cried at the pain and suffering she endured in order to make it to the happily ever after that she and Rick so richly deserved. I had never read the Halle Puma books before this one, but I bought the other three in the series after reading this one, because Dana Marie Bell created a world I wish I could go and visit, and I will time and again through these books.Originally posted at [....]","08 9, 2009",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...","A book to read, and re-read",1249776000

She is wrongly accused of being in league with her old best friend to take out the new female pack alpha.  Then she is severely injured helping save the life of another new pack member.  Oh and to make things worse she has also found her mate.  But he isn't a puma, he is a wolf, and she needs to be able to stand as his alpha.  This will be hard to do with a rod in her leg and a pin in her hip, she was hit by a car after all.When she finally gets to travel to live with her mate, Rick, she finds that there is another power hungry woman (Gina) who wants not only her man but her position in the pack.  Will she be able to finish the mating with Rick in time to have others let her heal?  Or is Gina beyond reason?  If Gina is beyond reason what will the outcome be to both Rick and Belle?The Halle Puma Series just keeps getting better and better.  In this installment we get to see just what happens when a puma and a wolf are mated, and the chaos that will result.  I think Steel Beauty is the perfect title for Belle and Rick's story.  I am not sure I have laughed this long and hard about the antics of a character in a long time.  When you get to the scene in the restaurant with Belle and Gina you will know what I mean.

A jack of all trades, he enjoys helping out where he is needed.  He never stays in any place too long before he wants to enjoy freedom again.

Before he leaves, however, he will try his best to get Ian and Cassidy together in each other's arms, where they belong not knowing that he will want to be the final part of their triad.Not a typical m&eacute;nage romance, Our Man Friday is a bit different.  I am used to having one couple already established prior to inviting a third and so the fact that Ian and Cassidy were just friends was original to me.  Cassidy's invitation to Kye was a bit far fetched because in this day and age, I don't see anyone inviting an unknown stranger into their home to sort through and look at financial records.  Kye was hot, I'll give him that but he angered me more than once the times he left Ian and Cassidy.  Ian and Cassidy's relationship evolved into something beautiful thanks to Kye.Our Man Friday by Claire Thompson is erotic and naughty.  The emotions of the characters are realistic but I just didn't buy into Kye's commitment to Ian and Cassidy.  I felt he was gratuitous towards them.  As a m&eacute;nage, Our Man Friday is scorching hot; as a true love match between all three characters of the m&eacute;nage? Not so much.

3975,B0026REA92,"[0, 3]",5,"After a year of self imposed celibacy following her break up with her former master Jane Porter is ready to get back into the BDSM lifestyle.  She's not looking for a lifelong love or even a long term relationship but she'd love to find a master who can bring out the full extent of her passion.Even after all this time Jane is still hurt by Peter's betrayal and knows trusting anyone with her heart or body will not be easy.  Her best friend and business partner Lily accompanies her to a bondage-themed event that their business R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up.  It's more than just networking for Jane though, it's her first foray back into the BDSM scene and she just hopes to find one man who appeals to her.Once they arrive at the party location, Lily and Jean Jacques settle into their non-interested attitudes despite the fact that the sexual tension between them is practically off the charts.  Jane's just waiting for Jean Jacques to toss Lily over his shoulder and show her just what she's missing.  Jane spends the evening hunting for a potential master for the night but no one's sparked an interest.  What she doesn't realize is that Antonio Villareal spotted her the moment she entered the ballroom and he has every intention of getting to know her - in every way possible.Antonio isn't having the best of luck when it comes to women.  Sure, he's rich, gorgeous and single but women are only after him because of what they'd gain by being seen on his arm.  He's looking for a submissive woman to share his life and has set his sights on Jane.  The only problem is she's told him upfront she isn't looking for a happily-ever-after.  Some really hot sex in the here and now will do wonders for her but anything further is more than she's willing to consider.  Will Antonio be able to convince her that she can have all the smoldering sex she could ever want if she'd just give him a chance?Dominique Adair's storylines are ones that I'm consistently drawn to over and over.  Her plots and characters never fail to draw the reader into the storyline while promising to seduce you with each heat filled scene.  In SEDUCING JANE PORTER we're introduced to Jane, a character who's love and trust was horribly abused yet she's brave enough to attempt another foray into the BDSM world.  Antonio is exactly the sort of master Jane desires - even if she isn't aware of it yet.  I eagerly read through this story and felt a profound disappointment when it came to an end.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","08 10, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

Jane and her business partner Lily own a party planning business called R.S.V.P., and Lily and Dirk, Antonio's brother, planned this birthday celebration for Antonio. It's a mascaraed/BDSM weekend where the invited guests stay at the estate for a fun filled party experience. So all guests are wearing partial masks, so every one is held in secrecy and anything you do or don't do is kept private by your mask. During the intro performance Jane is getting highly aroused, and Antonio walks up behind her and starts whispering suggestive things in her ear.

Basically, they take one book and chop it into 3 or 4 shorter stories with barely there plots.The fact is the cheap books sell better. So by taking a book and breaking it into parts and selling the parts at a couple of bucks each, you get more money and more sales...In my opinion the story suffers and the flow of the experience is corrupted.Seducing Jane Porter passes as a Reader's Digest story. Thin plot. Undeveloped characters. Just seduction, passion, heat that you really can't get into because you don't know the characters well enough to really care at all.Maybe I did get it for free so I should lower my expectations and be grateful, but frankly I gave my book time to this.

Jane Porter takes a vow of celibacy after finding out that her ""master"" is married (I put that in quotation marks because that is what she calls him, but she seems to be very unfamiliar with the lifestyle later in the story - it was difficult to figure out exactly what her experience level was).  After a year, she attends a BDSM-themed party she set up as a party planner.  This whole turn of events was so incredibly unrealistic.  First of all, a guy was throwing it for his half-brother.  Who throws a party like that for a  sibling?  Nobody in the book was engaging in any sort of negotiation or conversation about what they wanted to do.  It was just guys throwing their weight around while mouthing bland inane nothings like ""You know that a submissive is really in charge of the scene?""  Well, if that's the case, then maybe try talking about what she wants, what she is looking for in the scene, what isn't on the table for the session?

I just means that the author pulled moments to life that seem real.Masked and disappointed, Jane feels defeated that she will not be able to meet a man who will give her the satisfaction that she needs.  Then, tada!  Antonio, the birthday boy, seduces her into shivers.This book does have a huge cliffhanger.  I am usually not a cliffhanger fan, but it was inserted at the right moment.  I am looking forward to reading Educating Jane Porter which happens to be the second book of the Jane Porter series.Line of the book:Being a sexual submissive was similar to Double Dutch jump roping, once you learned to navigate ropes, you never forget the rush.I recommend this book to ADULTS ONLY.  This is an extremely erotic book filled with BDSM content.  There is your forewarning.

A few times it even switched to omniscient.  This was not only annoying, but extremely distracting.Also, one character seems to have some kind of secret that the author didn't want us to know, I assume until the end.  However, some of the story was even told from her viewpoint. Now, if you are basically in someone's mind, wouldn't you know their secret?One other point was that the emotions of the characters just seemed extreme. The main character would go from smiling & joking to an almost murderous rage from one sentence to the next. And, yet, no one seemed to notice his extreme emotional instability. They even referred to his 'boyish charm' or something like that.He seemed to me to be extremely emotionally unstable. Which is fine, but he wasn't hiding it & yet, no one seemed to notice.***Spoiler**** (not much of one since I didn't finish it, but wanted to warn)At one point, the main character's girlfriend tells the guy's best friend a story that leads the friend to think the main character had RAPED her. At the end of that conversation, he asks the woman to 'look out' for his buddy while he moves out of town. Yeah, if I think a woman's been raped, I would definitely tell her to be sure to be good friends with and take care of her rapist. &lt;sarcasm>I'm sorry. The premise seemed good, but the writing was not.I am giving 2 stars instead of one in hopes that perhaps the author will take this criticism and do some rewriting.

The zipper opens this sleeve 50 percent and can be kept on the device while it is charging.The biggest negative about this product is the price.  I bought this sleeve for my Kindle DX when Amazon featured it as a lightning deal for under twenty bucks.  But even at that price this is overpriced because Belkin makes a sleeve just like this for Apple iPads for under ten bucks.  Why the gross price increase for this one when both are so similar in size?All that aside, this is well-made and fits my DX nicely with very little wiggle room.  It provides good padding and grip, as all Belkin laptop sleeves do, and is ideal for carry-on travel or as protection for the Kindle DX while in a backpack or portfolio case.  But there's not much more room for anything inside this sleeve as there are no other pockets, so placing the recharging cord requires a tight roll.The gross overprice takes a star off an otherwise very good product.Edit 28 May 2011:  I see the price dropped from a ridiculous $44 to a more reasonable $29, but this is still almost $20 more than the just-a-tad smaller iPad cover of the same design.","05 17, 2011",A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,CGScammell,Well-made but well-overpriced,1305590400

It is not bad and the price is down to a lower level where it makes it attractive to some.It is made of neoprene stretch material and it has a faux leather portion on the front and back to give you a better grip.  The neoprene would be to slippery to hang onto while carrying your tablet.  It does protect your tablet from minor bumps and scratches but like I said, I have other cases that I feel are much more padded and provide better protection.If you are low on a budget then this case is not bad and it is better than carrying an unprotected tablet.  It is well made and it features a sturdy zipper close with dual zipper pulls for ease of opening and closing.  It will keep your tablet clean and protect it from spills but provide average or below average protection from drops.It may be too big for some size tablets and your device may feel loose in the case. The case only opens on two sides and you have to remove your tablet to use it.  This means that while using your tablet it is unprotected so this is something to consider when buying this type of case.  If you want full time protection then this case is not for you.  The advantage that this case has over cases that offer full time protection is that when you are holding your tablet and using it, you do not have the added weight of a case to also have to support.

Gregor is the second eldest of the Faustin brothers; from the Russian vampyr family line. He runs a series of successful clubs, made famous for the fact that they cater to New York's vampire population - a publicity cachet the clubbers love, and the vampyrs appreciate. Gregor has his pick of women, and is at the top of his game, so the last thing he needs is for fate to interrupt his life. But when you're a Faustin vampyr, you have to listen when destiny speaks . . . or suffer the consequences.Gregor is told the name of his intended bride - Madelena. But Gregor ignores the heads-up and continues on his partying ways . . . unsuspecting, until fate intervenes with a crash.`Bound by Blood' is the second book in Evie Byrne's `Faustin Brothers' trilogy. Though it is the second book, the plot timing seems a little out-of-sync with first book `Called by Blood'. In this book, Alex is a rampant bachelor and is yet to meet his wife, Helena. So really, it would make more sense that `Bound' be the first book in this trilogy, instead of the second ...I am really liking Evie Byrne's `Faustin' trilogy. I love the fact that Byrne is writing a modern vampire tale - her characters are clued-up about vampiric myths and fanged pop-culture icons, but there's also an old-world vibe. Each brother finds his bride through premonition - fated by their mother who has dreams of her future daughters-in-law. In `Called' Alex was ecstatic to finally find his bride, partly because his older brother had recently settled so well into holy matrimony. But as we back-track, it's revealed that Gregor in fact found fate to be rather inconvenient. I love that Byrne marries some old-world mysticism with modern inconvenience - a New York vampire club owner who is put-out by his destined bride. Hilarity ensues when fate intervenes, brutally.In `Called by Blood', Byrne took a very different romantic route - by severely burning her Alpha hero, and leaving him looking like raw hamburger meat. Byrne does it again in `Bound', this time posing a difficult dilemma before the heroine. I won't give it away, but I really liked the hurdle before Gregor and Madelena, if only because it completely turned the tables on the traditional vampire/mortal romance.I like Evie Byrne's paranormal romance.

He's let fame sideline him for a while but now he's back on track and determined that nothing will prevent him from achieving his goals - and since he's single there isn't even a woman to distract him.Sydney Hart is the little sister of his good friend Dusty and she's part owner of a Las Vegas bar called Cowboy Up.  Of course Levi doesn't know that before stepping foot in the bar and witnessing her rendition of Kelley Pickler's `One of the Guys.'  He's always thought she was beautiful but watching other men drool over her inflames all his possessive instincts.  He made a promise to Dusty years ago that he'd never touch Sydney - but some promises are meant to be broken.Sydney has lousy taste in men and never has any trouble attracting jerks.  Her last boyfriend is still obsessively watching her so she's not in any big hurry to hook up with another man who'll make her life a living hell.  Of course she knows enough about Levi to trust him to not be psychotic and there's definitely a sexual attraction that's impossible to resist.At first Sydney and Levi keep their relationship strictly on a friendship level but as time progresses and they spend more and more time together the attraction proves to be too much and one kiss quickly leads to other far more intimate moments.Levi has quite a reputation with the ladies and he isn't interested in soiling his relationship with Sydney by allowing the press to get wind of it.  Levi and Sydney's romance is as wild as their Texas hearts unleashed on a Las Vegas strip but can they withstand an angry brother and an obsessive ex?BUCKLING DOWN is a red hot scorching romance which is as hot as Texas - and as wild as Las Vegas.  Moira Keith installs plenty of humor, passion, emotion and non-stop action in this captivating tale.  Rodeo cowboys give women lots of moments of intense joy just watching the way they move so you can just imagine how exciting Levi is to any woman who comes in contact with him.  Sydney's got a spirit that matches Levi perfectly and keeps him coming back for more.

I really couldn't get a feel for how these characters looked---the author didn't paint a vivid picture for me.  In addition, I felt that the story wasn't well told.  So many details were lacking, especially the history of Sydney and Tyler's relationship.  What happened for them to break up? Had he always been crazy?  How did she not see this before?  For her to be such a feisty girl, why couldn't she have dealt with Tyler better?  I was not impressed with her hiding from him and nearly allowing him to rape her without much fight: ""At least she wouldn't be awake for it.""Now, let's talk about chemistry in the book.  The chemistry is quite tepid.  Sydney and Tyler kiss a bit, she gives him advice, they flirt, then they're headed to his hotel for sex. What??? I really would have preferred the book without the ONE sex scene. It was horrible.  The lackluster description of the sex is so vague I had to read it twice to be sure I was actually in the midst of a love scene!  This is definitely what I was expecting from a Wild Ride story, but then, I thought this author was comparable to Cat Johnston and Lorelei James.  Boy, was I wrong.  Even more frustrating, at the end of the book, I was surprised that Levi wanted a permanent commitment to Sydney.  Why?

They've been married for nine of those years and he couldn't imagine being with anyone else.  That's why their `trial separation' is proving to be the most difficult thing he's ever endured.He hopes that Libby will come to her senses and allow him to return to their home and her bed but it's become apparent to him that something has to change or he will lose her for good.  Quinn isn't one to talk about his feelings or show a lot of affection but after three months of separation he's willing to do whatever he has to in order to save his marriage.Libby McKay has never stopped loving Quinn but all the improvements she's made to herself and their home have gone unnoticed and she's afraid that the love and desire they once shared is gone forever.  She'd hoped that maybe a little time apart would rectify the situation but nothing she's doing seems to be enough to get him to fight for her.  It's a heartbreaking situation but it looks like divorce is imminent.Quinn does something completely unexpected and he reinforces the fact that he's staked his claim and lets her know that he has every intention of seeing that she gives him the second chance he deserves.  He even goes so far as to find new ways to show his feelings for her.  However, one of their biggest problems could simply be their lack of communication but maybe a weekend together could bring them closer than ever - especially if they're completely honest about everything that happened and what they desire from each other.Lorelei James' STRONG, SILENT TYPE really captures all the emotional angst that occurs when a marriage is in trouble.  What I especially enjoyed about this story is the genuine love that is evident in how Quinn and Libby respond to each other.  This is a relationship that deserves a second chance and really touched me because I can personally attest to the impact family interference and heartbreaking loss can have on a family and how much work it takes to keep your marriage from falling apart.  Lorelei James will touch readers' hearts with this memorable story which is not just very emotional - but also downright hot!

She couldn't go on the way they had been.  They were no more than roommates, and she decided to either shake things up, or let go and move on.  It had truly shocked her that he seemed to take it in stride until he saw her dancing with someone else one night at Ziggy's.  Quinn had lost his temper, and that gave her some hope, but when he walked away not wanting to cause a scene, she was ready to give up.When Quinn showed up at the library waiting at her car, Libby didn't know what to think.  Hearing him ask for a second chance, and his proposition that she spend a weekend alone with him, she didn't know what to think.  Libby was further surprised to hear his agreement that he would give her time to think after their time together that was uninterrupted and free from pressure.  They had been so far apart from each other the past year that Libby was afraid to get her hopes up.  Knowing this was their last chance, she skeptically agreed.This was a different spin in that we witness the demise of a good marriage between two basically kind hearted people.  They allowed other issues come between them, and instead of tackling them head on, they tried to deal with them alone separating them farther.  Can these two find the path back to each other?

The issue, here, is the Kindle offering, most notably, the price.Yes, it's expensive, and yes, I wish they'd reduce it a bit. But I'm not as outraged as some other reviewers.In comparing Kindle vs. web and paper, it is reasonable to consider, among all the factors discussed by others, the nature of Kindle itself. I notice that with the Kindle subscription, I find myself comfortably reading pretty much the whole issue. With print, I read just a small fraction.One factor, undoubtedly, is font adjustment. I'm getting to the age where reading hard-copy newspapers and magazines is becoming a bit of an exertion, so this is a huge factor. Of course web browsers allow for font adjustment, but I spend enough time working in front of a computer. I do cherish opportunities to do some things in different settings, such as an easy chair, or out on the lawn.I also wonder if the more stripped-down emphasis on text is a factor as well. There's not as much to look at with the Kindle edition (they do try to put in some pictures and charts, but visuals are not what Kindle does best). With the magazine, there's so much to look at, I spend too much time going back and forth. Ditto the web site, where there are so many things to click on. With Kindle, there are lots of little easily-digestible text nuggets and I just go from one to the next.I'm not sure if my explanations of why I read more on the Kindle version is accurate (I'll leave the details for amazon's usability experts to study), but I do notice the same phenomenon with my Kindle version of The New Yorker, where I abandoned the print version altogether.Speaking for myself, I'm getting a lot more bang for the buck with the Kindle subscription. Hence my willingness to tolerate the pricing.","09 6, 2010",A10KECJUJOBO9H,"Amazon Customer ""a reader from NYC""",A different view on pricing,1283731200

It is, and always has been, THE most credible, most respected, most prized news and financial magazine. And, being a British publication, it is well-written and smart. It is also well organized.To be sure, the magazine is opinionated and expresses that opinion. This is perhaps not a good thing. For example, in a recent article we read, ""America has proposed limiting these imbalance to 4% of GDP. That is too rigid, but there is plenty of scope for the G20 to agree on the ranges countries' current-account balances should reach.""This is from the ""Leaders"" section, not opinion or editorial. So the reader needs to determine if he believes the writer or not.Now, about the Kindle price. It's way too high and I wouldn't pay it. I subscribe to the online edition of The Economist and I use free software to put it on my Kindle. In fact, I do that with all my newspapers and magazines. I would never pay what Amazon charges.I read yesterday that Kindle is starting to offer publishers a deal: the publisher gets 70 percent and Amazon keeps thirty. That should mean more digital content for your Kindle at a lower cost. I hope so. But until then, don't pay this price for The Economist. Otherwise, I highly recommend it.-- Susanna K.

She's a little concerned about how the evening will turn out since she's aware that her ex, Peter, will be present.  There's a sense of pleasure in the knowledge that she hasn't let Peter's betrayal destroy her.Antonio and Santos have thoroughly enjoyed the time they've spent with Jane.  They've shared women before but Jane's the first one who's really brought out the possessive and protective instincts in both of them.  The men are stunned to learn about Jane's previous relationship with Peter and how long she'd been deceived.After learning about Jane's ex's disrespectful proposition and abusive behavior Antonio and Santos vow that they will pay Peter back for hurting their woman.  Jane simply wants to get on with her life now and forget that the relationship with Peter ever happened.  Besides why worry about the ex-jerk when she has the evening's activities to look forward to - and Antonio and Santos definitely know exactly how to get her juices flowing.While Jane's dealing with her men and preparing for the masquerade ball, her best friend Lily has a bit of drama of her own unfolding.  She and Jean Jacques have reached a stalemate in their relationship and he's openly flirting with a bevy of blonde bimbos.  She's insanely jealous but letting it show would be intolerable.  Fortunately Lily has a special friend who is more than willing to help her elicit a reaction from Jean Jacques - and even if he doesn't react well, Jane will have at least scratched an itch.REINVENTING JANE PORTER is the third book in Dominique Adair's JANE PORTER SERIES. I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each of the characters in this series and loved the sexual freedom that is such a prevalent theme throughout each individual story.  Jane's relationship withAntonio and Santos could easily be just three individuals indulging in their sexual desires but it's apparent that their feelings go much deeper than they'd expected.  Lily and Jean Jacques's heated encounters really got my heart pounding and definitely kept me in anticipation of each new scene.  In REINVENTING JANE PORTER we're treated to more of the characters we love as well as a couple new ones you'll love to hate and an additional suspense element that clearly displays the depths of the feelings between the characters.If you haven't read the first two stories in the JANE PORTER series I highly suggest doing so before reading this book.  The stories flow from one to the next and compromise everything from that occurs between Jane and her two men as well as Lily and Jean Jacques from the very beginning of the weekend.

I was extremely disappointed in the 30 some odd minutes it took to read it.This series is about a woman named Jane Porter.

Organizing the birthday party for Antonio would help put them on the board.  A seductive scene awaits her, she decides to end her celibacy and hopes to find a temporary lover.Yadda yadda, she meets Antonio.

Things become even more intensely delicious when Antonio introduces her to Santos, his friend and partner is shared sexual interactions.BDSM displays, slave auctions, Peter making an appearance, this book is filled with adventure, fun, jealousy and envy.One thing that somewhat frustrated me, was the lapse in relationship progression.  One moment, Jane meets Santos.  The next, she cares for him and they share an intimate and sweetly respectful relationship.  One sex scene between them and then WHAM! .. It progresses and skips an entire day of hello there, where did the sex go?This book ends better than most erotics.  I am looking forward to reading the fourth installment, Hot for Teacher.

There is sexual chemistry between them and these are illustrated graphically - another well written part of the book.My only concern about the book is the appearance of a mystery lady at just the right time to convince the lovers that the other person is just right.  Without calling this woman a ""ghost"" it still left me feeling like there was a ghost telling Brad and Lindsey how to feel about the other...not letting them develop those feelings on their own.  I enjoyed the story, the interaction (verbal and sex) and the conclusion.  Just wish it felt more real instead of something that a ghost wanted.

She's determined to focus on the interior decorating company she runs with her two best friends, Anna and Candace.  But their newest assignment, turning an old Victorian home into an inn for lovers, is about to turn Lindsay's celibate world upside down.  With an unlimited budget and an assignment to design a room any way she wants, Lindsay plans on creating a BDSM fantasy suite.  But to do that she needs a wall taken down, and that brings sexy handyman Brad Caldwell to her door.  Will being in close quarters with an intelligent, hardworking, drop-dead gorgeous man be enough to make Lindsay give up her vow and take a chance on love?A touch of magic adds spice to this delicious fantasy tale by Cathryn Fox.  All Tied Up is a red-hot start to what is sure to be a wonderful series.  What's wonderful about both Lindsay and Brad is that neither is all that they appear to be on the surface.  It was lovely to watch them uncover each other's layers the more time they spent with one another, both in bed and out.  Both Lindsay and Brad are incredibly likeable, making me root for their finding happiness with one another.All Tied Up is the first book in Ms. Fox's Pleasure Inn series and I finished the story incredibly eager for Anna and Candace's books.

With a touch of magic and a bite of an apple, she hires the three women who share a design company to renovate an Old Victorian and turn it into a sexual retreat, with each friend taking a room to decorate according to their deepest fantasies. Lindsay Bell, the bawdy bad girl of the trio, is intent on a BDSM room that'll tickle her fancy. What she hadn't planned on was gorgeous handyman Brad Caldwell to help her. Soon all Lindsay can think of is trying out - with Brad - all the new toys for the room and getting Brad to take her where she's always wanted to go...the pledge to swear off men be damned.Unfortunately, I had some problems with this novella on just about every front. Beyond the set up of the concept for the plot, there just wasn't much attention given to plot or character development, and the relationship between Brad and Lindsay suffered as a result. Seeming perfunctory and shallow, neither lends to the sort of tone that would allow for a seductive BDSM scene...but that doesn't even really become an issue because the 'play' in this role play was exceedingly tame. Not that I would have wanted hard core, I didn't. But I just couldn't suspend my disbelief...and a bit of distaste...in part because the development of the characters and relationship were so sparse, and in part because I just didn't buy the idea that Lindsay would in just a few days time share with Brad a kink (a relatively harmless kink, really) that she'd never mentioned to any of her other boyfriends before. There are just too many problems with that all around.There was an attempt to add some depth to Brad's character, and much of that attempt succeeded. I liked his issues with wanting to go to med school and the problems he's had with women over his blue collar job. He and the not-quite-a-cat were my two favorite parts of this novella. I wish there had been more time spent on and with both of them and less on Lindsay, who's unrelenting focus on sex and not much else turned me off.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","08 14, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",All Tied Up is a Bit Knotted,1281744000

4162,B0028AEAG0,"[2, 2]",4,"It is an interesting book in many ways. To be blunt, I find the ending to be an easy cop-out to avoid taking things to their natural conclusion. And that's the only reason why I don't rate it 5 stars to be honest.This book is a first-contact book, but it's much better thought out than most other of the genre. There are logical reasons why there hasn't been much if any contact before, and there are logical reasons why when contact is established, it's found that the universe is filled with life and other sentient species.I found the science parts to be just enough to make it believable, and I have real respect for the care the author has taken in making the world seem logical and plausible. In addition, he doesn't turn to magic or 'just how things are' in order to solve something which can't be solved in any other way. Except - of course - for the end, which I'll get back to.The politics of earth are logical as well. I see some have reacted badly to the US being perceived as the 'bad guys' - but to me, the US here are the good guys, they simply can't trust the bad guys on earth and the natural conclusion to that, is that things get worse not better. But, I don't see it as the fault of the US or the western nations - I see it as a natural conclusion of the tension between nations, and that some of the 'bad' states simply can't be trusted. Normally, this sort of politics don't work for me in science fiction, but here - it does. Because the author doesn't condemn unnecessary, instead he logically points out the differences where they are, and let the logical conclusions happen - even when they are bad.And I do enjoy the characters, and how they interact and what their abilities let happen.But ... the end feels forced. The author does resort to 'magic' or 'faith' or 'God' or whatever you want, to let it happen. And ... I feel that everything is wrapped up too neatly.(SPOLER ALERT)It simply feels to me like the author took parts of the ending of watchmen and tried to make it work but without the emotional impact or the vilification of an outside source. It feels too easy to me, and how everything is neatly fixed and everyone falls in line, through what in my eyes is basic manipulation. People simply don't change their minds that fast, and I have a real hard time believing that the majority of the aliens would change their opinions that fast when they don't have the incentive that humanity does).(SPOLER END).In the end, I give it 4 stars and I recommend checking it out.

It is a very well-written, thought-out, and developed book, and I'm sure a select audience will enjoy what it contains, it just wasn't for me.  I  thought the world building was great, and the cast of characters diverse.  There were space battles, innovative technology, and even a dash of romance.Now, I enjoy having things explained to me, especially when it contributes to the mental image I can bring forth when looking at a fictional universe. However, in this book entire chapters were devoted to the descriptions of the technology and the related physics involved, as well as the extensive workings of the political sphere and social changes as described by the passive voice. This took me out of the story, made it a struggle not to skip ahead,  and screwed with the pacing of the book.  It also sacrificed character and plot development which could have helped the flow, and (IMO) more action which would have made it a more fast-paced, enjoyable read.I also disliked the protagonist and found him an annoying perspective to follow.  He, and various minor characters, were not simply naive, but held a sense of idealistic pacifism about them that made me shake my head and think, 'surely you can't be this stupid'...  He was also whiny, sheltered, easily distracted, and incredibly trusting; leading to him refusing to believe anything was wrong until everything had gone to hell.Finally, the book was just plain depressing to read.  The same political, religious, and social problems we have today are prevalent some fifty odd years in the future. The essence of humanity, our ability to rise up and conquer anyone and anything that threatens our existence and freedom (something most military scifi novels embrace) simply wasn't there.  Humanity almost self-destructs, they're treated with suspicion, experiences defeats and failure at the hands of others, is at multiple times at the complete mercy of others... This coupled with a disappointing and lackluster ending really made me wish I hadn't pushed through the difficulties to finish the book.","03 22, 2012",A163C6RV585I6Q,Fate,"Depressing, but well-written hard scifi",1332374400

It is a very classic fantasy tale with a lot of humor woven throughout.Wistril and his apprentice, Kern, live in Castle Kauph and in general just want to be left alone to their studies.  In these three stories about Wistril, that is just not meant to be. The three stories included are Wistril Besieged,Wistril Afloat, and Wistril Betrothed.  In each story Wistril shows that brain always triumphs over brawn and comes up with humorous solutions to rather difficult situations.I thoroughly enjoyed these stories.  Wistril is a pretentious, yet caring and hilarious wizard.  He constantly surprises the reader with his crazy solutions to problems.  Kern is a very competent apprentice who weaves tons of hilarious sarcasm throughout the novel.  Wistril is sworn, as a white wizard, to never harm with his magic and this adds an interesting twist to things.Tuttle has a very readable writing style that I really enjoyed.  He develops wonderfully quirky characters.  These stories really have a classic kind of tongue-in-cheek dungeon crawling humor to them.  I was pleasantly surprised and very amused.Overall I absolutely loved this book.  I immediately went online and got a couple more of Tuttle's Kindle books.

Each of the stories has a unique plot with interesting resolutions.My favorite was the first one. Having it first in the collection was a great idea as I think it did the best job of introducing the two main characters and how they played off of each other.The central theme throughout all three is basically ""Use brains, not brawn."" The author sticks to that concept in interesting ways.The sense of humor I have come to expect from Mr. Tuttle is present in each story making for a very fun read.I would have liked a little more background to better understand the vow taken by Wistril, how it was enforced, etc.Character Development: 4 StarsThere was a ""Forward"" included that introduced Wistril and his apprentice, Kern. While helpful, I have always felt that stories should speak for themselves.I didn't expect as much character development in the first two shorter works. The third one was much longer and should have given us more insight, especially into Wistril's motivations.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle's writing style is an absolute joy to read. His humor and vocabulary, which includes some words that won't be found in Webster's, make his work shine.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors, but not so numerous as to spoil the mood.

Anything from nurturing orphaned sea monsters to learning the correct cutlery arrangement for an Oomish engagement party to undermining the underpinnings of a bridge may be required of them at any time.Kern's adolescent snark is authentic and well done, and Wistril has some great lines, (""The Oath prohibits offensive arcane actions, not malicious carpentry""); but his character could use a bit more development - rounding out as well as rotundity.

But by the time I got to chapter 4 I was so riveted that I couldn't put the book down. It sort of boggled my mind to know that any woman could ever forgive a husband that had married her, when he already had a family two states away. And what's even worse... then she moves to that same city where the other family lives, so her children can still be close to their dad. I have to tell you...that just blew my mind.

Both Carter and Elizabeth must deal with their pasts before they find a future together.  Although The Other Woman can stand alone, I recommend that readers first pick up Reenie's story, Big Girl's Don't Cry (Harlequin Super Romance #1296), as it is not only a great read but also will adds the background to this story.

She's been living and working in Great Falls but her father's ranch is where her heart truly lies.  There's just the little issue of her love for Wolfe, Cash and Travis and how wrong loving them seems.Brothers Wolfe, Cash and Travis have been in love with Stacy for years.  They've done their best to protect her from her father's bullying and hateful attitude.  They've never expressed their feelings to Stacy and now with her father gone they feel it's time for her to come back to the ranch - where she belongs - as their woman.Stacy's guilt over the perceived wrong on being in love with three men is emotionally agonizing.  She's convinced her only option is to sell the beloved ranch and return to Great Falls as soon as possible.  Only first she has to consult the attorney about the property and for some reason the man is never available.  That means she spends a lot of time around the ranch and avoiding Wolfe, Cash and Travis is impossible especially when each of them keeps such a close eye on her.  When each man individually seduces her she becomes even more confused and scared.  Despite the men's insistence that she is home, she's determined to leave and doesn't believe there's any way she can confide in them about her feelings for them all.  As it is she's afraid they're going to find out that's she's cheated on each of them with their own brother.  Only there are things that Stacy doesn't know which will shock and change everything she's ever believed.  Will she stay after learning the truth about the ranch and what her father did?HER DAKOTA MEN takes readers on an emotional journey along with the characters as each comes to grips with their feelings and what they mean for their future.  Stacy's generous nature and love for the ranch and everyone who resides there really touches your heart even as you wonder how she could be such a sweet person when her father was so mentally abusive.  Wolfe, Cash and Travis are wonderful men who want nothing more than Stacy's happiness - and for her to stay at the ranch.  They're all dominant men by nature and their interactions with Stacy are beyond scorching.

Because Jake and Lucas were kicked out of their packs at a young age, much of the werewolf culture is unknown to them so when Leyland announces that they're his mates, he's an omega, and that he'll be mating them both...well, let's just say that shock is the least of the reactions! None of the pack have ever heard of Tri-Omegas so Leyland has his work cut out for him educating everyone on what it means and what his additional powers are.

And I want you, baby?""""Baby?""""Well, sex on a stick just seemed too long to pronounce, so, yeah, baby.""The attraction is instant when Leyland and Jake meet - it's that werewolf mating thing, when you find your mate you just know it! - and they pretty much get it on straight away. The sex scenes are sizzling and I don't think I have ever read a sex scene on horseback before - very unique!With mating and claiming comes instant love and the conversation reflects this. There are some lines that should sound corny but are just adorably cute. It's so sweet to see Jake's alpha instincts kick in and him to go all protective over Leyland.The complication lies in Leyland being a tri-omega. He needs two mates and regular claiming, just to stay alive. The third in this relationship happens to be just the guy I was hoping it would turn out to be and the three together are brilliant, with the relationship being well balanced.It is so amusing the watch Jake, the Alpha, in action with his mates. ""I don't understand this. I'm supposed to be the alpha here. I'm the man in charge, the ruler. How is it that neither of my mates gives me any respect? Where did I go wrong?"" Jake said to no one in particular.There's a nice theme in this series about acceptance and understanding. The Tri-omega is unique and there is some question about the rest of the small pack accepting Leyland's place with their Alpha. ""Gregory, I didn't ask to be born this way any more than you asked to be born below an alpha ranking.We are born to be who we are, and nothing can change that. Our only choice is how we use what we have been given.""The only part of the story I really didn't enjoy was the punishment dished out to Leyland by his mates, albeit at the advise of his fathers. It was essential to the story line but I still didn't really like it as it seemed too much that they were treating him as a child.This is a story that does contain some world building, particularly in explaining the role of the tri-omega to the pack but really this is limited. The story is more focused on the relationship building.Note: There were quite a few editing errors including spelling mistakes and strange symbols in my Kindle version but they weren't too distracting for me.

He knew werewolves had soul mates, but in his case he had two and someday he would find them, but he never expected his current photography job to lead him to the both of them.Meeting first Jake and then Luke, Leland didn't think life could get any better than what his two gorgeous mates had to offer him.  When Leland finds that Jake, the alpha of the pack, was already in love with Luke, his omega, Leland starts to wonder if there was a place in their life and hearts for him.Secret Desires is a fun and enjoyable story.  Leland is just adorable and he holds his own against his big, gorgeous and very overbearing lovers. Jake and Luke are the alpha and omega of a pack that chose to be with each other after being shunned by their own birth packs.  The chosen pack were wolves that really cared for one another and I think Leland fit in with them nicely.  Leland's mother, who was also a tri-omega, was a crack up.  She was so matter of fact and blunt it seemed like nothing fazed her.  It was obvious Leland took after her and not his two fathers.  Aside from Leland, Luke and Jake's romance, I was also very interested in Ryland and Gregory and I'm excited that the author Stormy Glenn isn't letting their story end with Secret Desires.

4247,B0028TXRVK,"[0, 0]",2,"I've read several of Glenn's books over several series. Before reading this volume, I had read every other volume of this series (except the newest 1, vol. 7; it had not been published when I finished reading the other 5). I had not read this one, because I didn't think the books needed to be read in sequence and the summary for this one just didn't interest me enough to want to read it. Since I thought 7 costs more than what I wanted to pay, and I'd been waiting for several months, a year at least I think, for her to finish the series, because vol. 6 actually ended with a cliff hanger - I decided to just go ahead and read this volume for the sake of completion, in the mean time while waiting for the price of vol. 7 to lower, if it lowers.Well after reading vol. 1, I wish that I hadn't, but I'd been curious about how Jake and Lucas got together with Leyland, because all the others manage to refer to their relationship and the 'incident' that they had with Leyland where he almost died, at least once. Since the first vol. of the series, that I did read, explained the issue with the tri-omegas having to find their 2nd mate, once they found the first, I could deduce why or how it was the Leyland nearly died from being grounded to his room for several days. Therefore, I didn't think that the actual circumstances that led to the grounding, but just what nearly happened as a result of the grounding, was pertinent to the plots of the other volumes. In conclusion, I didn't need to read it to fully understand any of the vols. that I did read, if I didn't want to.I tried to like Secret Desires, after one read, but I just couldn't, not enough to want to keep it or suggest it to anyone else. I liked it from the very beginning, when no one other than Leyland had been introduced. I found it amusing, but then Jake was introduced, but not Lucas. And I started to wonder why Jake greeted Leyland alone without Lucas. I knew that Jake and Lucas had been together 10 years for the summary. I assumed that the summary meant mated. It didn't. And when I figured that out, I got rather disappointed with the story. I couldn't understand how Jake and Lucas after being in love with and sleeping with one another and sharing a bedroom for TEN YEARS, didn't realize that one another was mates, despite the fact that they really, really didn't believe two men could be mated, if after seeing - not touching or actually meeting - but just seeing Leyland ONCE, only once, Jake knew without a doubt that Leyland was definitely his mate, since Leyland was ALSO A MAN. I'm not sure how the author didn't see that glaring contradiction in her own work. A good friend of mine, suggested that it's probably due to not having an editor, because that's the sort of things editors catch and bring to the author's attention, before she publishes a work.The three of them Jake, Luc and Ley got things sorted rather quickly and that was good.The gaping contradiction, was just too hard for me to ignore, and that's the not so good part. Now if you have read any of the others, like vol. 2 and 3 which have the same contradiction and 4, which is the exact opposite, where the two regular wolves are mated before they meet the tri-omega and then one of them recognized the tri-omega as his mate upon the first time he met him, but the other didn't. (The 2nd one was drunk, and furious due to major jealously at the time, plus tired and sleepy, so maybe that was his excuse. Can't say, because the author never explains.) I was able to let it slide in the 2 and 3, because, in those cases, the tri-omegas 2 mates had not met and been involved before meeting him. Instead, one met the tri-omega first and got involved and then the two of them both met the third and pretty much the same time and together. So it was easier to ignore.I just couldn't get over how Jake could drop the love of his life for 10 years, for someone he'd never actually met, and then have sex with the guy - Leyland - on the way back to the house that he shared with said long-time lover. Really?!! And then when Jake and Leyland get to the house, and Lucas realizes that Leyland is his mate too, Jake immediately doesn't want to share. So first, he breaks up with Lucas, taking himself as a lover from Luc and two, when he learns that Luc actually has a fated mate, same as he does, because it just happens to be his also, he doesn't want Luc to claim the guy right away, like he just did, until HE can figure things out. So while Jake has everything including something he's always dreamed of, but never thought would happen - his fated mate,Leyland, plus Luc pining over him, poor Luc, on the other hand, has NO ONE and nothing, just immense, nearly unbearable pain and suffering, while 'Jake' figures things out. And to add insult to injury, Jake gets to have his mate 'while' he figures thing out and Luc gets to live in the same house and watch and listen to the man that he loves 'and' his mate, be with one another while he's alone and can't be with either, nor even claim his mate, Leyland, whom he has just as much right to as Jake dose - while 'Jake' figures things out.  I liked Jake; he seemed to be a good guy for the most part, but I thought in his excitement of having a mate and his rush to claim him, Jake's behavior toward Luc, the man he'd loved for 10 years, was greedy, selfish and insensitive. I don't think finding his fated mate, was a good enough reason for him to just go off and claim the guy in the way that he did, with the sex, before giving poor Luc any chance to even try to adjust. Haven't they heard of dating!! He could have just tried to get to know Leyland first, for awhile without him even being at the house or living there at least, without claiming him, while giving Luc some time to try and wrap his mind around the whole thing. But no, after only being broke up for only a few weeks, not even a month, he moves another man - fated mate or not - into the room that he had shared with Luc while Luc is still living in the same house! Really?! That was awful!!!! In my opinion it was. Fate or not, there is a right way and a wrong way to do a thing. And that was not right way. To me the author comes across saying that their love for anyone else, means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, when compared to being with their fated mate. Yes, everything worked out in the end, but neither Jake and especially not Luc knew that.Jake gets his mate, great and wonderful, and Luc just gets shafted and not in the good way. And Jake couldn't find a way to be more sensitive about it. I don't see that a fated mate allows them to just disregard someone that hey are currently involved with.I had wondered what one of them, a shifter, would do in a situation like that where, he/she met their mate, but was already in loving monogomous relationship with someone, that he/she had been with for a long time, at the time.  When I finally read an example, though, - I really didn't like it! Well sometimes, that's how it is.Yeah, I know it's fantasy, but I take love very seriously. So I don't like it, when a character in a story, is supposed to be the good-guy or the protagonist, and just treats someone they love horribly for any reason, other than to save a person's life or to like save the world (family, town, country, universe, space and time and we know it) or something of that nature.","01 29, 2013",A7NFENLP58F5R,the Q,"Not the Worse, But Not the Best",1359417600

Shouldn't be too hard, right?Comments:- A short book (1936 kindle locations), but it is a complete story arc. Although this is the first in the series, it would standalone.- The sex is m/f and m/f/m/m with exhibitionism. Aiming for a committed 4-some. But it isn't particularly steamy. Perhaps more clinical than lusty. Disappointing.- Elain starts off being this strong, interesting, independent woman. And Ain is an Alpha who wants to give her choices and wants her to take them willingly, not because of some genetic imperative. But when push comes to shove, Elain rolls over because she's too horny for words and Ain takes away pretty much all her choice and goes all ""you must submit"" on her. Oh and he does this ""she needs to go into this with her eyes open"" but doesn't bother to explain the marking ceremony? or the Alpha imperative? Not impressed. She should definitely dump him, if it was at all possible! And while I'm at it, Brodey and Cail are supposed to be Alphas too but all they ever seem to do is hang around with puppy dog looks. Get a spine!Opinion:There is nothing particularly unusual about this ""erotic"" shifter romance, except for the ""marking"" ceremony. The bedroom scenes were pretty dull and the characters not terribly appeailing. One of those books where you don't really care if they get a HEA and firmly doubt they would stay together 2 months, let alone 200 years, without Elain giving up her entire identity.[Since writing this review I have read ""Storm Warning"". Some of the issues of the first book are rectified in the second. I don't think that changes how I feel about the first - if you can't grab the reader and convince them to read Book 2, then why bother with an open ended plot? But it is nice to know the plot holes were perhaps deliberate, not an error of bad editing.]","05 1, 2011",A1ZN2JLLR9GI3T,cathyr,Three werewolves on the make find themselves a (mostly) willing Mate,1304208000

Finding no one to claim him, Elain agrees to take him home with the hopes of finding his owner.  She has no idea that the huge furry dog is not actually a dog but a wolf. Nor does she even think to consider that the wolf is not a canine but a man.  When the dog's owners show up to claim their lost pet, Elain is sad to see him go but returns him anyway.  The next day, she receives a phone call from one of the owners inviting her to lunch.  When she meets the man, she is surprised to see he is a twin and that both men are luscious. Allowing them liberties she never even could have considered, Elain's life changes the minute they touch her.Ain, Brodey, and Cail are identical alpha triplets.

No m/m. Aiming for a committed threesome.- While ""Dakota Ranch Crude"" is part of an anthology, it isn't a *series*. These books are in no way connected and can be happily read independently.Opinion:Although the suspense is a little wussy, the romance is very sweet and the sex terribly HOT. Shayne and Jackson are sexy Alpha-types, but not so overwhelming that they smother Sam. Sam has strength, character, and intelligence - when they order her around she listens, takes it on board and understands why they are making these demands. No one is demeaned or treated as a child. They all take an intelligent, thoughtful approach to their relationship and respect each other. It's Nice. And when they come together, it's Hot. An excellent book. Recommended.Aside:Although we have strongly Alpha men who like their woman to follow the rules they've put down for her ""safety"" and ""own good"", they are no where near as Dominant as the men of Brooke'sDesire, Oklahomaseries. If you are looking for that style of book, this anthology is not for you. There are no bdsm aspects, no Domestic Discipline on principle, and the menage relationships are private rather than a societal expectation. Rather we have a good set of menage novellas with strong romance, steamy erotica and mild suspense plots.

Evidently they feel the same way because Samantha has just agreed to become their housekeeper for the next year in return for the Montgomery brothers allowing her brother to go free.

When a neighboring pack is called in to do cleanup and discredit the bashers, the sheriff, Caleb, turns out to be a werewolf, an Alpha of his own pack and also recognizes Micah as his mate.

He steps up in protective mode, placing himself between the smaller, delicate Micah and the men who are taunting him. He doesn't hold back in proclaiming his attraction to Micah and demanding respect at which point the bullies are surprised to learn he is gay.(I had a quote I wanted to insert here but Amazon keeps rejecting it due to 'naughty words' so get out my review on Goodreads or my blog if you want to see it.)Thomas uses his wit and humour to defuse the situation only to find that Micah has left but not before leaving him a pink rose and a note. (Luckily Micah had a rose handy!)As per the other books, sizzling hot sex without much buildup - cause when you know the guy is your mate you just go for it - instinct just demands sex and claiming!There is another incident where Thomas need to protect Micah. This time he needs to use his special skills so makes Micah close his eyes while he deals with the bad guys. Finally he resorts to calling in the pack's ""clean up"" crew to help him and Micah get away. Unfortunately Micah overhears some of his conversation - he must have had good hearing to overhear both sides of the conversation. ""What did Jake mean by shifting? Into what? A werewolf? Really?"" It's quite funny to watch he reaction to finding out this pretty momentous news but just seems to accept it, more annoyed about the lying rather than the actual werewolf thing. ""Okay, it is a little weird, I think I already said that, but we all have our idiosyncrasies. Yours just seem to be a little stranger than most. So what? It still doesn't change the fact that you lied to me.""The local pack is dispatched to the scene to help out and the Alpha just happens to be Micah's other mate and claims him before Thomas becomes aware. This leads into the bulk of the story - the challenges of being a threesome, the tri-omega complexities & secrets from Micah's past.I did find Caleb not very appealing when he first joins the story and at times Micah was a little annoying (referred to a spunkiness in the book).

Can Caleb and Thomas share? Does Micah even want any part of this crazy life? Will Caleb's pack accept them?This was probably my favorite story, so far, in the whole series.

That's how he meets Micah. Micah is his mate, the person fate has destined for him, and Thomas naturally feels an irresistible attraction to him. Thomas makes love to him, claims him by biting him (cementing the mating bond), and convinces Micah to come back to his ranch with him. He figures he'll explain the whole ""werewolf"" thing later.On the road back though, they're accosted by gay bashers. When you're human, you really don't want to threaten a werewolf's mate, and Thomas soon as them beaten silly. When a neighboring pack is called in to do cleanup and discredit the bashers, the sheriff, Caleb, turns out to be a werewolf, an Alpha of his own pack, and *also* recognizes Micah as his mate. It turns out Micah is a tri-omega, a rare Omega werewolf that has *two* mates. Caleb doesn't want to share, Thomas doesn't either but realizes he must, and the three head back to Caleb's pack to try to form a trinity together.My problem with the story is that Caleb is a total jerk. He has little to no empathy for Micah. When Micah gets frustrated and overwhelmed with emotion from the negative feelings pack members give him, he leaves the house against Caleb's orders, and Caleb makes it clear to him that if he ever disobeys him again, he'll take it as a personal challenge. A challenge to a werewolf is a fight to the death. So in essence, Caleb is telling Micah that he's to stay and obey him... or die. Hardly loving and worthy of having mate. I felt Thomas should have been appalled at that behavior. Even though they're both mated to Micah, he should have been quick to jump and let Caleb know that he would never allow Caleb to threaten him. Thomas is a mate too and will fight to the death to protect his mate. He should have made Caleb realize that Micah was basically uprooted from his entire life and is now being treated as a prisoner, of course it's going to take some adjustment time. And even if they're werewolves with their own, they also live in modern society and are not foreign to the concept of individual's rights. Eventually, everything works out, but the bad taste left in my mouth from such boorish and threatening behavior from Caleb marred an otherwise totally enjoyable story.Still, if you've read the other Wolf Creek Pack and Tri-Omega series, it's worth it to read this one too.

4274,B00292BSVC,"[2, 3]",4,"Having read the first Rachel Myers book, Blind Malice, and then skipping to Appalachian Trail Mix,the fifth book, I decided to go back and pick up with number 2.  Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge takes place while Myers is getting settled in the mountains after moving back from Arizona.  Jackson does a great job of combining the the everyday, seemingly thousands of little things that have to be done during a relocation, and the investigation of the death of Isaac Starling's best friend. I really relate to the Myers character as a real person; she's not  perfect, just someone who likes horses, likes gardening and doesn't mind getting her hands dirty doing real work. I'm not a big fan of flashbacks (there's one really long one) but Jackson handles it beautifully so the reader does not lose sight of the current story.  My own love of doing research in graduate school makes me admire Myers' determination to leave ""no stone unturned"" to find the killer. This one may cause me to buy my own Kindle.","02 7, 2010",A1F4GT5CZEU1I6,Reacher2,Parkway Plunge!,1265500800
4275,B00292BSVC,"[3, 3]",4,"I read this one first, when it is actually #2 in the series.  I loved it!  Rachel Myers is a character that I really like.  She took her time to decide that she wasn't ready to commit to marriage to her beau in Arizona and decided to give up a good job that she'd held for 16 years and move back to where her roots are in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  I also chose this book because I've been all through the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and it brought back nice memories of such beauty.Once Rachel gets about halfway settled in, her friend Isaac comes over to ask a favor of her.  A friend of his died by falling over a cliff to his death below, but police have ruled it either suicide or an accident, but Isaac knows in his heart it was neither.  He wants Rachel to do her own little investigation of this incident.  In between getting her house ready, her gardens done with the help of a landscaper, buying a new car, and meetings for her work, she manages to interview a lot of people who could be connected to Isaac's friend's death.  Some of them certainly have good motives, or at least it seems that way.One of the things I loved best about this book is the gardening and the discussions of the different kinds of flowers and plants that Rachel has.  I could just smell the lemon verbena (which is so hard to control!) and was amazed at the different kinds of hosta. Rachel is someone I could easily be friends with, and she would make a great conversationalist and just an all around fun friend.  There is humor in the book, tension, suspense and romance.  Her new suitor hopefully works out, as well as her new job.I intend to download as many as I can of these mysteries.  With cozy mysteries like this one, there is always something new to learn.

It takes place much later than other books in the genre, for instance, and technology yet to be developed figures prominently in the story.For the first 50 pages or so it appeared to me that the author was an outsider, a non-Christian, who found the Christian end times prophecies intriguing and worth entertaining as an exercise in creativity, not to be confused with advocacy or belief.The emphasis on action and spy-thriller trappings bothered me a bit, but I have to give props for creativity, good characters, and a plot that supplies context for the fulfillment of the requisite end time prophecies. The dialogue includes some brief but well conceived discussions on a number of Christian themes. I also appreciate his nod to Asimov, sci-fi nerd that I am.I docked a star for the above-mentioned spy thriller violence/emphasis and for too many usage, grammatical, and other mechanical issues.","02 4, 2013",A2S2SYTO57W4J0,KrisztinaP,The End Times ala Hollywood,1359936000

Or so she thinks.Antonio Villareal is every inch a Master.  His sexual exploits are legendary and Jane can attest that he's definitely a wonderful lover.  Only she hasn't fully experienced everything he's got to offer because he hasn't introduced her to his best friend Santos yet.  Antonio and Santos enjoy sharing a woman and Jane's about to experience being mastered by not one but two men.Jane and her best friend and business partner, Lily's company R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up the events this weekend. However, it's their extracurricular activities that are holding their attention.  Jane's caught up in her sexual encounter with Antonio and the new knowledge that he shares women with his best friend Santos.  She has to admit that it's a fantasy she enjoys but never seriously considered being in such a situation herself - until cornered by Antonio and Santos.Her friend Lily had her own sexual experience but her emotions are in a tizzy over the event.  Lily and Jean Jacques are strong minded individuals and he's definitely a Dominant male so the simple fact that she won't accept his dominance over her is going to cause all sorts of problems.  Jealousy, hurt, and a power struggle are at the forefront of their relationship.  Can they get past their need for control and admit to their feelings?I've reached the conclusion that Dominique Adair is a cruel woman - or maybe she just enjoys teasing us - in either case, she's definitely got me hooked with her JANE PORTER stories!  These stories capture your attention from the very beginning, build your anticipation, engage your emotions - and then you discover that you'll have to wait for the next story to find out what happens next - and believe me, you'll want to know what happens next.  These characters are highly memorable, the sex scenes are beyond hot and conversations are delightfully wicked.

But the stalker is still out there, and getting closer, and now Adrian wants to Mate her, is she strong enough to keep them both safe?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 1982 kindle locations, 20,000 words (short novella), but finishes around 1704 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent, *happy*.- ""Cat of a Different Color"" picks up as Book 1 ends. Sheri was introduced in passing as the discoverer of Becky's issues. Adrian has made cameos as Max's optometrist partner.- Sheri has ""type one albinism"" - she's legally blind (20/200), sensitive to light, and has a seeing-eye dog, Jerry. Bell addresses her issues with care and sensitivity, emphasising Sheri's strengths and abilities.- Sheri is also the survivor of domestic abuse. She ""got out"" before it became too bad, but he has since stalked her. Sheri is a smart and intelligent woman who made some bad choices that haunted her future.- As a ""series"", the first three books should really be seen as a trilogy where the stories support each other. You *could* read them independently, as stand alones, but would get more satisfaction from reading them in sequence.- Includes excerpts fromFelicity Stripped Bareby Vanessa Jaye, andDunmore Risingby Gia Dawn.- There is a ""free read"" available on the author's website which gives us a little epilogue of Adrian and Sheri, ""The Ornament Book 3"".Opinion:Another clever novella in the ""Halle Pumas"" series, Bell gives us action, love, caring and respect. The Mating Imperative is rapid. The ""I love you""s come pretty fast. But the shifting is important, the one-liners are fun, and the sex is steamy. I like it. I like the series. And I am happy to recommend them.4.5 stars rounded up. Sheri has strength. The book is short but the care Ms Bell has taken in giving Sheri a handicap, and a stalker, is worth the read.

4358,B002A4MICW,"[15, 15]",5,"Optometrist Adrian Giordano isn't looking for a mate.  He's quite content with his life exactly as it is - a successful business, friends and occasionally even dating.  His best friends have both succumbed to their instincts and mated but Adrian shudders at the thought of being accountable to a mate.  At least that's what he thought before meeting Sheri.  Now he can't imagine his life without her.  All he has to do is convince her that he's the only man for her.Sheridan Montgomery has recently joined the Pride.  She's been resistant to joining the pack because of her ex's obsessive behavior and she didn't want to drag anyone else into her mess but she's running out of options.  Instinctively Sheri knows that Adrian is her mate but she's determined to deny it as long as Parker remains a threat.The Pride welcomes Sheri with open arms - and after hearing her story a network of protection is put in force.  Sheri's thrilled with her new friends, home and part time job working at Wallflowers.  Her only real worry is how long it will be before Parker makes a move.  She's successfully ignored her Puma's need for Adrian and continues to deny it to herself and everyone around her.  It's the only way she can protect him - or so she thinks.  Fortunately, Adrian isn't willing to wait for her to come to her senses and he practically kidnaps her and carries her off to his home where he claims her properly.Just when it seems that Sheri could have a real life free of worry over Parker's next move he strikes.  All Sheri's desires to protect Adrian fall by the wayside as it's determined that he is the Pride Marshall.  It's his duty to protect the Alpha and the Pride from threats and he takes his duty very seriously.  No psycho wolf in men's clothing is going to harm his mate or anyone in his pack and live to tell about it.  Of course like any feline he'll have to torment his prey a little before going in for the kill.CAT OF A DIFFERENT COLOR is the third story in Dana Marie Bell's HALLE PUMAS series.  I've thoroughly enjoyed all the stories in this series but this one really stands out.  The characters are larger than life, ballsy, lovable and flawed and because of that they seem very real.  If I wasn't in love with the PRIDE before I certainly am now!  Sheri's caring and generous nature makes her a genuinely likeable character but when you add her disabilities into the equation then she's truly an inspiration.  Adrian's simply delightful and perfect for Sheri because he is so protective and he isn't swayed by her arguments.In addition to the normal cast of characters we've come to know and love in the HALLE PUMAS series we're introduced to another character in particular, Richard, the new Alpha of the Wolf Pack in the Poconos.  There's a showdown between him and Belinda, a Pride member who's having difficulties finding acceptance in the Pride.If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.

She was injured so severely that Max Cannon, a friend turned her into a puma to help her recover from her injuries. Along with her albinoism, she is legally blind. After being found whenever she moved she finally contacts Max to ask for help from him and his pride of pumas.Sheri has just moved to Halle and is working part time for the mates of the Alpha and Beta, but she needs to be introduced to the pride and approved as a pride member. Adam Giordano the pride Marshall is delegated to give her a ride to the pride meeting, as soon as he sees and scents her he realizes that she is his mate, Sheri realizes the same thing but both of them deny their feelings - of course that doesn't last for long.Sheri's attacker has followed her to Halle, Max the puma leader contacts the Alpha wolf from the Poconos pack for help against the rogue wolf and his small pack, Sheri is guarded and Adrain steps up to make sure she is protected by him - her mate. Sheri knows that Adrian will be attacked when the crazy wolf realizes they are together.The plotline for this was tight and very well conceived, the action is still limited by the length of the book but I liked this story very much.

Isn't the saying you will find you mate when you least expect it?  Well this is what happens to Adrian.  He thought he was happy with his occasional weekend date, thriving business and friends.  He found out differently when Sheridan Montgomery comes to town.  She is the former college friend of Adrian's best friends and has come to ask for help in the form of joining the pack.  Oh did I mention that Adrian and his friends are puma shifters?While Sheridan has been a loner since she was changed, she needs help with a stalker (former boyfriend) who has gotten way out of hand.  When she meets Adrian her inner cat tells her that he is her mate.  But, she fights it as she knows her stalker will be a death threat to Adrian if he suspects that she is mated to him.Can the pack help Sheridan with her stalker?  Will Adrian and Sheri be able to overcome the obstacles and mate as nature wants them to?After reading Cat of a Different Color my first thought, was ooh interesting, I had never thought what would happen to a were animal that was an albino, and the challenges they might face.  Add to this the dynamic writing of Ms. Bell, her alpha male characters, and a woman being stalked, and you have a winning combination that pulled me in from the first page.  I am now going out to find the rest of the Halle Pumas series.  I found that Ms. Bell handled the struggles and serious nature of stalking with the importance that it needs and at the same time was able to build a strong relationship between Adrian and Sheri.  I hope if you like were animal romances you will pick up Cat of a Different Color and I believe you will have an enjoyable read.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","07 22, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Cat of a Different Color,1248220800

4373,B002A4MIDQ,"[10, 12]",2,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a paranormal romance series that focuses on Norse gods in modern America. Not a good read: awesome concept, blundered execution. I'm a fan of Dana Marie Bell's work. Her ""Gray Court"" series is my favorite. This, however, was a TERRIBLE example of her work. Awkward and confusing, this story never really evens out and pulls you in. You're left wondering what on earth is going on and how on earth such childish people could be GODS. Please don't judge this author's work by this book!STYLE: In typical Bell fashion, the atmosphere was light and fun and the story is relatively SHORT. Trouble is this DID NOT WORK for this concept, though. Norse mythology has an imposing cast of characters and implies nobility and power- yet it was thrown at you all at once, liberally sprinkled with trite humor. Not only did you have to figure out which god was which, but then you had to remember what their modern names were- who was related to who- who had what power- what they all had to do with our story! It was a mess. Truly a mess. It was MUCH better suited for a more serious book- a longer story where it could have unfolded better.CHARACTERS: Undeveloped and silly. These were supposed to be Norse gods, but they somehow all came across as the cast of a bad tv series. There was no depth. Their actions felt forced because they weren't given room to develop and they were almost all interchangeable. I couldn't tell them apart except by checking which name was mentioned and then assigning the dark hair to one and the light hair to the other and giving up on the supporting characters. Also, given all of the various relationships it seemed vaguely incestuous...BOTTOM LINE: Not worth the time. Perhaps if you are a fan of this author and find this concept interesting, you might want to go ahead just to see if the series improves. If you haven't read anything from this author before- DON'T start here. She's really very talented! I'm not sure I'll bother with the next book. I just didn't grow to LIKE these people.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)2. R.G. Alexander's threesome themed para-eroticaWicked Sexy: Wicked, Book 1- very simple stories, but I wasn't impressed by book 23. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- with frolicking dolphins and alsoStormchild: Pacific Passion, Book 1- with multiple seaside creature shifters. Both VERY SHORT.4. Anya Bast'sWitch Fire (Elemental Witches, Book 1)- romance with a little more substance5. Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe (The Gray Court)- sexy, humorous para-romance with all manner of fae: Sidhe, dragons, leprechauns, vampires and more.6. For fans of manage... Marie Harte'sRachel's Totem- lighter, less developed para-erotica featuring a variety of shifters in a quirky little town. Also,Roane (Circe's Recruits 1)- para-erotica around genetically engineered shifters who bond through sexual connections7. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.8. Sydney Somers' gargoyle spin on romance:Primal Hunger: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 1and her less-adventurous witch-centric ""Spellbound"" series Say You're Mine","04 30, 2011",AQNXEOJ4RPCGW,A.

4374,B002A4MIDQ,"[2, 4]",4,"I do agree with another reviewer: if you aren't up on your Norse mythology, this book is hard to follow.  There are a lot of characters crammed into a small space, and there's way too much assumed knowledge on the part of the author.  That's the bad bit.So why four stars?  Because I found the interaction between the three main characters: Logan (Loki), Kir (Baldur), and Jordan to be just wonderful.  Bell is great at creating distinct characters that shine through their actions. Paranormal romance is often bogged down with melodramatic dialogue.  Bell's conversations are delightful--they are the kind of laughing interactions I have with my own friends (er, minus the sex).  Additionally, there was a great sweetness to the romance that was a treat to read.So here's my tip: if you want to really enjoy this book, read a quick primer on Norse mythology first.  It will be worth it.  I know I'll be reading up a little before the second installment.","04 26, 2011",A2H9JE8YGL44VH,Catherine Winterfox,Great character interaction,1303776000

As the years go by the man they are running from, Oliver Grimm, gets closer and closer to catching and ultimately destroying them.  Determined to end the battle between them and Grimm, Kiran and Logan search out Grimm's step - granddaughter and private eye Jordan Grey to help them.  When they meet Jordan they find they have two tasks at hand; convincing her that they are Norse Gods on the run from Odin who was framing them for murder and who happens to be her step-grandfather but more importantly than that is convincing her that she belongs in their bed.Jordan doesn't know what to make of the two gorgeous men that walked into her office, but from the moment she met them they turned her world upside down.Very Much Alive is a very eclectic story, with gorgeous shapeshifting Norse Gods, hot sex and a plot that carries over centuries, but it wasn't enough to hold my interest. I found the characters to be very irritating especially Kir and Logan and Jordan's siblings. However I did like Jordan, she was the saving grace of this story.  I think the author was going for quirky, tongue and cheek with this story but it didn't come across very well. Men shape shifting into cars to drive their lovers around just didn't work for me.  Although Very Much Alive was not my cup of tea, it could be a fun story for others.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","10 26, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Very Much Alive,1256515200
4376,B002A4MIDQ,"[17, 19]",1,"I really looked forward to enjoying another one of Dana Marie Bells' book since reading all of the Halle Puma & Shifter series several times over because they were that good.  Unfortunately, this book was a huge disappointment - I had to force myself to finish it.  Many times I stopped reading, went on to another book that I actually enjoyed and then forced myself to go back to it with the hope that it would improve to only be more disappointed.  I just could not get interested in the story or characters.The main characters, Kiran and Logan are really the Norse Gods, Loki and Baldur.  A major problem for me in the first half of the book was that I simply could not keep straight which character was which god and had what supernatural powers.  I have read Federal Tax Laws that were clearer.  While the Norse Gods concept was unique, it was also very confusing to the reader unless one was very knowledgeable about Norse mythology in the first place.  The Norse mythology was also a little too much for such a short novel because it forced the author to find a way to introduce the different Norse Gods, their different powers and relationship to each other which just led to MAJOR bewilderment.  Many times things were not clear until much later in the book when the reader was fed a little more background on the Norse mythology which then made a much prior passage make sense, somewhat, sometimes.  The story might be interesting if reread after a ""cheat sheet"" concerning Norse mythology is made by the reader but quite frankly I still do not think I would be any more interested in the characters or story than I was the first time around.As for the ""hot sex"" scenes that another reviewer mentioned - maybe explicit but that did not make them ""hot"".  To me, the scenes were more of a ""throw in"" because that's what is expected in a book that is supposed to be an erotic romance and I had long stop caring whether there was any romance between the characters.Note to Author:  Please Dana - return back to the Halle Shifter series and let this series stay in the past like Norse mythology.","11 24, 2010",AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,Rare Reviewer,Bypass this series,1290556800

This one is no difference, but I did struggle a bit which is nor normal.The characters were complex, changing names during different times, with several conflicts existing simultaneously.The world was confusing at Tim's, simply from the fact that there were apparent vast differences in time between.The characters were well developed and it's a creative story, without a doubt.  I simply struggled a bit throughout the story, having to frequently remind myself who was who and what their conflict was.Maybe it's just me...but the struggles I had with the complexity definitely removed a bit of the enjoyment for me because I had to spend so much time rehashing the past in my mind, in order to put together the current.Other than that, it was q very creative story and well structured - just complex.

This is a very brief explanation of a steamy story.Between the highly erotic intimate scenes, Jayne Rylon manages to sneak in a plot with enough heart to keep the eroticism from reeling out of control and completely overwhelming the story.

4402,B002AJ7X2C,"[0, 0]",4,"Serial is a short story that tells a thrilling tale of what happens when two serial killers meet unknowingly.  One of the serial killers is a man, appearing to be elderly and harmless, who preys on innocent hitchhikers; the other is an innocent-looking young girl who plays the role of a hitchhiker, killing whoever picks her up.  The first two short chapters deal with introducing these serial killers and their very gory habits in murder.  The third and final short chapter has them meet up and finish quite an interesting story.  Now, know that this is a quick read, (you'll probably finish it in under 30 minutes) but it is still very entertaining, assuming that you don't mind graphic violence and murder.  The killing in the story is vivid without being overly explicit; to be honest, I found it to be pretty hardcore, but some readers may find it to be rather tame if they are used to extremely explicit stories.  Obviously, the development is amazing because of the fact that this is a short story, but overall, I think the authors did very well in writing this story.  Overall, this is a violent tale but also a chilling one that tells a very unique and interesting story.  I really enjoyed it, and I think fans of serial killer books will enjoy it, too.NOTE - In addition to the story in this ebook (which really only takes up about 2/3 of the ebook) there is an included interview with the two authors interviewing each other and two excerpts from books that they each wrote solo.Warnings - Mild Language, Sexual Insinuations, Very Graphic Violence","12 18, 2010",A3ANETCTMAN1NP,&#308;&#308;,A grotesque and thrilling short story,1292630400

Unfortunately, while a good read, it doesn't live up to its full potential.A driver picks up a hitchhiker. Kills him. A hitchhiker is picked up by two stoners and kills them. Third chapter: The serial killers meet and all hell breaks loose.Except that hell is a little bit predictable. But graphic.I had to read the story twice. I didn't read the description or advance marketing copy before beginning the story so I was not prepared for the POV shift in the second chapter. It confused me until I went back and read it again. The cliffhanger from the first chapter appears to lead in to the second chapter quite naturally, but the POV shift was a shocker until I understood how the authors collaborated and who wrote each part. After that, the story made better sense. That's probably my fault for not reading the promos.Still, the writing is not completely terse. There are parts of it that can be tightened. Adverbs where none are necessary. Sentences that could have been shorter. But these are nitpicks. The plot and story line are actually decently implemented.The problem is the authors could have spent a little more time on the collaborative effort in chapter three to make it more unpredictable. Some of the characterization is a little flat even for a short story. Otherwise, I'd say it was a decent read.Doesn't quite deserve four stars, but it's better than three stars.

And for my first, I thought that I would dive right in with the horror/thriller story, Serial, by Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn (aka JA Konrath).Goodreads description:Remember the twin golden rules of hitchhiking?#1: Don't go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.#2: Don't pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be raving nutcase.So what if, on some dark, isolated road, Crazy #1 offered a ride to Crazy #2...This story was a short, quick read, written in a very unique way. According to the info at the back of the book, Kilborn and Crouch each built their killer, and their killer's pre-story before sharing what they had with one another. Then, they collaborated and finished it up together. Sounds sweet, huh?It's anything but sweet. As far as stories about kindred souls finding each other go, this one was dark as all hell. Even in such a short format, Crouch and Kilborn are able to stick you into the warped minds of their characters, and make you never want to be on the side of the road again. It's gory and perverted and definitely not for people with queezy stomachs.I give it umm... (wow, hadn't thought of a rating system so I guess I'll be generic for now) 5 Stars. I was hooked from page one, Serial is well written and the characters grabbed my attention. I would recommend Serial for anyone that wants a quick and bloody read.I wish it was longer, but to be fair, there is a longer story out there, Serial Uncut, that I haven't picked up yet.

Trust me it makes sense if you ever read it.The Novel Serial is a lot like if Dexter met Dexter but neither one of them had a moral code.

4437,B002AJ7X2C,"[1, 1]",3,"Serial (which is currently only available for the Kindle) is a novella co-written by horror writers Jack Kilborn (a.k.a. J.A. Konrath) and Blake Crouch. The story grabs your attention immediately with a great first line: ""The hardest thing about killing a hitchhiker is finding one to pick up."" As that sentence and the book's title should suggest, the subject matter of the book is disturbing. It's definitely not for the faint of heart.The story is told in three parts. The first section, written by Kilborn, is about Donaldson, a serial killer who likes to pick up hitch hikers and do bad things to them. His latest conquest and Donaldson's subsequent disposal of his passenger's remains are described in lurid detail. In the second part of the book Blake Crouch tells the story of another serial killer, Lucy, who is arguably even sicker than Donaldson. I won't ruin the surprise by describing her modus operandi. The third part of the book was co-written by the two authors, who took turns contributing 100-odd-word snippets until the story was finished. But they did so blindly, without the benefit of having read one another's initial sections. (The authors describe the writing process in an interview section following the story.) The last segment reads like a macabre chess match as the two killers meet and, unaware of the other's nature and intentions, try to outmaneuver each other. The story hangs together very well, particularly given its mode of composition. And it ends fittingly, if not surprisingly. The story doesn't offer anything by way of character development, but it's a quick read and it certainly holds one's attention for the short time it takes to read it.-- Debra Hamel","09 27, 2009",A1RFQVHBKVN4TA,Debra Hamel,Okay for the price and investiment in time,1254009600

Chapter one shows the grandfatherly-looking serial killer known simply as ""Donaldson"" torture and kill a hapless hitchhiker that he picks up at a rest stop.  Chapter two shows a woman serial killer named Lucy torture and kill two guys who picked HER up hitchhiking.  Chapter three is serial killer Donaldson giving a ride to serial killer Lucy, and the fun begins.The story is graphic and visceral and not for the squeamish, but don't worry- it's not torture porn.  Jack Kilborn (who's really thriller writer J.A. Konrath) and Blake Crouch are pros who know how to tell a story, not talentless hacks just describing an ax falling and hacking off limbs (not that there are scenes as unimaginative as a simple ax attack here).  Yes, you will graphically be told what implement, say, Donaldson decides to use against his victim, and, yes, you are clearly told what Donaldson does with the implement.  But the facts are related quickly, without excruciating detail.  The rest is all in the reader's head.  Kilborn and Crouch give us what our neurons need to know to get started, and sit back and let us fill in the rest.  That's why it's such a hoot to read some of these other Amazon reviews that complain about the ""too graphic"" nature of ""Serial"".  In the end, these nastily clever guys realize that good horror writing- even graphic horror- ultimately comes from a formula of one part writer and three parts reader.""Serial"" is about the length of a longish story in ""Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine"", and- truth be told- could probably appear there with only a little re-writing to tone it down from its current Hard-R or NC-17 tone.  After all, most of the story consists of interesting character exchanges (lots of dark-tinged banter, especially), moments of clever set-up, and plenty of good suspense... all things that have to do with decent writing and not graphic bloodletting.After the story's over, ""Serial"" is rounded out by a fun, illuminating  chat between the two authors and moody, entertaining excerpts from two of their books, making the whole package good for an hour or two of edgy entertainment on the couch or porch. Even if ""Serial"" goes up to a buck or so from its current bargain price of ""free"", this would still be a worthwhile download for your Kindle.","06 11, 2009",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

4455,B002AJ7X2C,"[0, 0]",2,"A very short story by two authors who wrote about two different persons with sadistic murder fantasies. Definitely not for those who have nervous disorders, heart ailments, gastric problems and those who are very sensitive, since this short story reveals how some people get wild pleasure and horrific thrill in killing a person slowly and painfully using some of the most deadly methods and instruments to kill.The basic underlying warning from the authors is about hitch-hiking (getting a free-drive  on the highways and expressways, from un-known persons).Two short stories, one with Donaldson (an elderly freelance courier man) and another Lucy (a young female guitarist). The first picks-up young boys and girls looking for a ride on the highway, ensures an isolated place and kills them most brutally after raping them. The murder is so horrendous that the victim is made to suffer the slow death by chopping off his/her vital organs one by one. Donaldson enjoys the screams and pain of the victim while doing so. Finally he burns the remains of the dead victim to keep the police clue-less. Similarly another young girl Lucy chooses cars on the highway for a lift/ride and uses a different strategy of injecting a slow poison in the drinks of her co-travelers. Later, she handcuffs the hands and ankles of her victims and ties them to their car with a rope. Then she enjoys the ride by brutally dragging them along the highway, first slowly and later at high speed, eroding them of their skin, flesh and bones one by one, until the point that only part of their skeletons are left.Absolutely no idea why the authors chose to write these stories, but I feel that they are one angle, inciting fresh sadistic and cruel ideas into the minds of the readers through such works. Any sensitive person might get heart stroke or nauseating effect while reading those parts of the book where the hunters enjoy the brutal murder process through their innocent victim&#8217;s extreme sufferings. Hope such people like Donaldson and Lucy do not exist in this world.Coming to the positive part of the short story, it is an indirect warning to road travelers on the following points from the authors.1: Don&#8217;t go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.2: Don&#8217;t pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be certifiably crazy.My rating is 2.5/5","11 26, 2013",A2LNVIYOP4RTO5,Kiran KK,Hitch-hiking is dangerous,1385424000

I clicked to read the blurb and thought I hit the jackpot. A perfect horror tale: what happens when one psycho serial killer picks up another psycho serial killer hitchhiking? Of course, I had to know.This little story was an experiment by two authors, Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn AKA J.A. Konrath. They decided to write this in 3 parts. Kilborn wrote part 1, Crouch wrote part 2 and they both collaborated on part 3 via e-mail. What we are left with is an edge of your seat slasher story that seems perfect to be made into a movie (which I now heard it has been optioned for).The first part sets up the story of psycho #1, the second sets up psycho #2 and of course, #3 is where they meet for a showdown. What happens is a race to see who will outsmart who and who will walk away from it alive. I only was left wishing there was much more to the story as it was just too short to have any real character developement.Now Kilborn and Crouch have expanded the story to Serial: Uncut, which is supposed to be the full length novel. But they they came out with more. Killers. Then Killers: Uncut . Then Birds of Prey, Truck Stop, Bad Girl. Each one saying it was the ""must read backstory"" or ""the complete story"" . Then came Serial Killers: uncut. This is supposed to be the REAL complete novel. I hope so.  Honestly, I kinda felt like I was being set up to keep buying more downloads. Luckily, they have been offering them free on amazon off and on and I think I actually got the whole ""epic"" as they refer to it. The idea for this is a great one, but I wish they would have just made it in its entire story at once. I probably would have actually paid for it, if it was complete, but glad I  didn't since I kept having to add new pieces-some of which were included in others I already had. Not that free is anything to complain about, but I know they go from free to $2.99 to $.99 and back. If I had paid for some of these, I really would be mad. I waited for Serial Killers:Uncut just because from experience I knew at some point that one would be offered free as well. And it was. Just as I do not like when a cd or dvd is released and then the ""extended version"" is realeased weeks or months later, it is the same with books. Seems a bit gimicky and I think the authors had this intent all along. Now there are ""prequels"".

It is very graphic with violence, but I didn't think it was much worse than some of the thrillers that are out there today that I've read.  The two authors collaborating on this agreed that one mind was as sick as the other, and I'll agree, but I think the plot of two serial killers working alone and then what happens when the two of them meet up is very clever.  I read this very fast because I couldn't wait to see what happened.  This isn't SERIAL UNCUT, but a shorter version of it.

I was getting bogged down in a history book and was looking for something quick and easy to read as a sort of mental palette-cleanser before jumping back into the second half of a rather long history book. Viola! There was Serial, a quick-read about a killer who preys on hitchhikers and a hitchhiking killer who preys on drivers and the mayhem that ensues when this unlikely pair meet. Toss in some hype about how each of the authors wrote a chapter featuring one of the serial killers, then collaborated on the final chapter in which the killers meet and it sounded like it might be a promising story. So I downloaded it. After reading the story in about 20 minutes I can definitely say this is a book that was worth every cent I paid for it.I guess I shouldn't complain because it was free ... but even so, I got the feeling that Serial was less about a unique collaboration between two action/horror/thriller authors wishing to share their experimental fiction with readers than writers finding a new way to foist rejected first drafts on readers. Other than the authors competing to see who can come up with the most gross-out scene, there's not really much to recommend the story. Don't expect any character development or insight ... just prepare for a story that could have easily been told with sound effects: Screech, thud, smash, scream followed by slurp, clang, thump, bump, scream. If you like your reading to be all action and no introspection, then by all means go for it.Oh, and as a postscript, I notice that Amazon is now selling an ""extended version"" of Serial.

I am fascinated with the clever way he clues the reader as to the accuracy of the various parts of his writing by attributing the ridiculous and hilarious stuff to some other character, and then making sure the reader knows of the departure from the truth by insinuating that he doubts the veracity of their story.Even so, as with all of Twain's work, it is imperative that all of his writing be taken with a ""grain of salt"", and a reader's ability to separate the facetious, from the facts. For example, I remember a story in which he makes derogatory statements about an Indian standing out in the snow and watching the author eat a nice hot meal through the window of a warm and luxurious restaurant. Some people have actually been turned off of Mark Twain because they did not realize that this was his way of illustrating the inherent injustice of the scenario. Having yet to revisit that particular story, I look forward to reading once again, what I have always considered to be an excellent and heart-felt illustration of compassion on his part.Mark Twain's writing seems simple, but he is quick and clever in his presentations and has a remarkable command of the language. So if you are up to matching wits with him, I heartily recommend his work, and in particular this large collection.","08 18, 2012",A1LBRVE8W2E2G1,Joseph E Botts,A Real Deal for Twain,1345248000

No where on this page does it classify this book under &#34;Christian&#34; anything.  Although I have not read this story to its completion yet I have read the sneak peak preview.  I am making this review now because of the 1 star reviews about the &#34;sex&#34; and it falling under a supposed Christian classification.  I certainly understand some readers being offended by overly graphic sex or even some sex in a book and not wanting that type of material.  What I don't understand is although it may have slipped under the &#34;Christian&#34; radar in recommended books why would a person purchase this title when NOWHERE in the DESCRIPTION or ANYWHERE ELSE on the PAGE does it reference &#34;God&#34; or &#34;Christianity&#34; once? I even clicked on the author to see if her other titles were &#34;Christian&#34;, there was only one other title and it was not of the &#34;Christian&#34; genre.  There are several genres that I do not like and will not purchase (Vampires, Dark Paranormals, Created Science Fiction) but due to crossing genre lines, Historical mostly, I occasionally get titles in my recommended list that are not what I want hence &#34;RECOMMENDED&#34;. I don't normally purchase a title under 300 pages because I have found that it takes at least that many pages to develop a decent story. This is actually one of those stories, not much over 100 pages.  That is the very first thing I look for is the length of the book. I normally would have just moved on to the next recommended title when I saw that it was a short story.  With this it just seemed strange that the ratings were so far apart.  In reading the reviews I found out why.  Seems unfair to the author to give a 1 star review because a reader didn't check the material before purchasing it.  If it was classified &#34;Christian&#34; I could understand those reviews but it is not!  I am giving it 3 stars at this time because I have not purchased the entire book, just the preview.

I'd say the author's biggest strength is her humor.  I'll give an example.  The hero had the heroine in a bath (she wasn't feeling well at the time so he was trying to bring down her fever), and she asked, ""What am I doing here and why do I keep touching your lovely chest?"" It was the last part that had me laughing out loud.  Even as I think of it now, I'm laughing.This is a good book for people who like women disguised as men stories where the women are strong and fully capable of taking care of themselves.  The heroine was no wimpering female, and the hero was lovable too.One thing I don't understand is why this was tagged as a Christian romance.  If you're familiar with the traditional market for Christian romances, this is not tame enough to be termed Christian.  There's stuff in here that would be deemed offensive.  Though the hero and heroine never went all the way, they did go pretty far, and since Christian romances don't go beyond the kiss and some readers thinking necking is ""lustful"", I don't know if I'd recommend this book to women who are uncomfortable with nudity and touching body parts that are usually covered.  (For me, this is not a problem, but since I've seen some reviews by women who expected a very clean Christian romance and got upset with ""necking"", they won't like this book.  But if you like a little more realism in your book, then I say go for it!)Like I said, I have no problems with this book.

Little does she know that trouble, in the form of a vampire, is only the beginning of her journey to discovery. What she learns about herself, her strengths and the lengths she'll go to grab onto and keep her happiness is what made me enjoy this story so much. Another point in this book's favor is the author didn't constantly dwell on the typical internal angst that easily could have taken over this story as its conflict. Rather, she concentrated on the joy of it and I found that even the pursuit of happiness requires a diligent commitment to the earning and giving trust. Without it, there can't be emotional growth.Gabriel is the hero and alpha of his pack. He's not the typical political and heavy-handed ""I'm the alpha, that's why"" kind of character. He's a bit more laid back, mostly because of where he lives, his environment and his ignorance that werewolves aren't the only thing that goes bump in the night. In fact, he finds out the hard way that movies are so, so wrong on a lot of things. Gabriel is an alpha for a reason, however, and that becomes excitingly apparent when the tension and suspense picks up. Another thing I like is that he's not a know-it-all. Gabriel makes some misjudgments which, though at first glance I felt were a character flaw, I then realized that he is fallible, like everyone else. Just because he is a paranormal creature doesn't mean he's not going to act like a typical guy - clueless. I had real sympathy for this character from that point on because he really does love Kiera and he's so `guy' about expressing it.The villain is, of course, the vampire. He's a jerk. A warped, twisted, arrogant being of whom I thought the author depicted quite well. I had no sympathy for him at all so he's the perfect bad guy.Other secondary characters populated this story, some sounded a bit too good to be true, some were endearing and two made my interest spike. It was a good balance all around. The dialogue was fast paced and moved the plot along.Moonlight Hero is not only romantic, but it's exciting and captures the joys of being a couple who know how to heat the sheets (and do something else that I'll not tell you about).

4560,B002AVVGNW,"[0, 1]",4,"4 and 1/2 stars! A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney is captivating, somewhat sad, yet sweet in its ugly duckling theme. Louisa believes herself to be ugly, not just unattractive, but actually ugly. She hears the snickers when she enters a room, the horrible insults launched at her back as she passes by, and knows that no man truly wants her for anything more than her extensive dowry. When she encounters the dark stranger who lives in a cave, keeps to the shadows but whose soothing voice and demeanor intrigues, and attracts her, she soon learns that there is more to a person than what is reflected in the mirror, or in others' eyes. Douglas fears that trying to live in the world alongside those who are so different from him endangers all who cross his path. Soon he learns that whereas normal is a concept which all humans strive to obtain, no one is truly normal and he may be accepted for his differences more easily than he expects.This dark, sweet novella about love overcoming diversity and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder will keep you enthralled from the beginning moments, when Louisa discovers the cave home of Douglas to the reveal of his dark secret, a lovely dance in the moonlight, and their eventual happily-ever-after. I highly recommend reading A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney for any number of reasons listed above, but mostly because it's just that good - in fact, I wish it had been longer.***Copy gifted as part of subscribing to author's newsletter.

Like a moth to the flame Louisa and Douglas are drawn to each other despite numerous reasons against their friendship.  Louisa is an extremely rich heiress who has inherited every unfortunate facial feature in her family.  She believes she looks as much like a horse as is humanly possible.  None of her suitors can see past the face to the person and beauty beneath; to her honesty, fairness, intelligence, and compassion.  They pursue only her fortune.  It shouldn't still hurt but it does and keeps her separate from everything and everyone, an outcast.Douglas is voluntarily an outcast and hermit when Louisa stumbles upon him in the hidden cave.  Douglas is also a vampire.  Not the traditional blood sucking variety either.  Really interesting and I've only read a few like him.  He can ""read"" Louisa's thoughts and know her inner self.  All her beautiful qualities are revealed to and cherished by him for their rarity.  For her part Douglas is always hidden in shadow so Louisa knows nothing of his looks, only what he reveals through actions and words.  Together Louisa and Douglas discover friendship that blossoms to more even as Douglas tries to shove her away.The difference between how we see ourselves and how we look to another when viewed through the eyes of love is the center of this wonderful story.

It was a charming, romantic retelling of the Beauty and The Beast story set in Regency England.  Louisa, an heiress, was an ugly duckling who wanted someone to care for her, not her fortune.  Her parents had passed and she was living with her grandfather who wanted her to be married.  Douglas, a vampire with a conscience, was a loner in the extreme.  He was living in a cave with no interaction with others besides what he physically needed to survive. He had his own inner demons to fight as he was guilt-ridden from an incident early in his life.  The day Louisa stumbled upon Douglas' cave was a life-changing event for both of them.  Karen skillfully used their interplay of words to develop their relationship.  There were a few other characters and scenes interspersed in the story but most of the story took place in the cave.  I enjoyed this book very much.  I was very happy with the ending and actually came away from the book feeling as if I'd learned a valuable lesson from it.

4570,B002B9MGD2,"[1, 1]",5,"You Can Leave Your Hat On is what the title promised, a naughty little novella on a stripper and his lover. The starting point of the story is one I already see in the past, a young and handsome College TA, Harlan, who has the hots for his even more handsome, a slightly older, College professor, Sawyer. The book respects the rules of a May / December romance plus the College setting with an Office Affairs theme... the shorten the thing, this is the classical romance by the rule, with the twist of being a gay romance. So I would say that it can appeal both to the old fan of the gay romance than to a newbie who wants to try her hand on the genre.Being Sawyer older and also Harlan's superior, he has all the trouble of the case: he can't take advantage of his position, he doesn't want to be involved with a younger man who can have everyone he wants, and plus there is also a little problem of appropriateness... Harlan to make the ends meet has a side job as a stripper in the local gay club, and Sawyer saw him at his workplace. So the point if Sawyer is gay is no more a question, but now there is the biggest problem that, even if Sawyer manages to move on the fact to have a relationship with a student, the fact that said student is a stripper is a big NO for the career of a college professor.And so Sawyer didn't make a move on Harlan, stopped to go to that club, and forced himself to have a strictly professional relationship with the boy. Only that Harlan is not of the same idea, and as soon as he reaches his graduation day, he is also ready, willing and naked for the professor to take. Harlan has all the cockiness of his young age, he is really convinced that Sawyer is avoiding him only since they have a professional relationship to preserve, and he thinks that, as soon as that problem is over, Sawyer will be all his to take. In a way I like how daring and careless Harlan is, but this only proves that he is really young.Being Harlan one of his students, it's not the only problem for Sawyer; there is also the question of his side job, as a stripper, that is not exactly a good visiting card to prove his willingness to commit and being exclusive; and then even if Harlan wants a real relationship, it's not said that Sawyer wants the same thing: he is arrived at an age where or you start to think seriously to commit, or you run at the minimum hint that there is a chance to be shackled... There is quite a controversy inside Sawyer, he is jealous of Harlan, mainly due to his job, but he is also skittish when it's time to commit and give something real to Harlan. Where Harlan is open and maybe careless, at least he has his mind clear and he knows what he wants... for all the years Sawyer has more than Harlan, he has not yet reached that level of maturity.Anyway this is a novella, mostly and erotic novella, with a lot of sex scenes, hot and nice, and all in all it spans only two days in the life of our characters, so there is not enough time to develop a lot, but I have the idea that the author has something more in mind, since she introduced some supporting characters (Harlan's brother, Rhys, and Sawyer's friend, Macon) that have too much deepness to be only a passing spectator.","05 29, 2009",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,You Can Leave Your Hat On by Lena Matthews,1243555200

Harlan worked his way through college as a male stripper and drawing on that experience he sets into motion a plan to seduce the object of his desire.Sawyer refused to get involve with his student no matter how much he was attracted to him. Even though Harlan will no longer be his student, Sawyer is still hesitant to get involve with him because of his job at the strip club.

Physically, Sawyer and Harlan were hot together, but outside of the bedroom, I didn't like Sawyer very much.  I found him to be very rude and domineering and I did not like how he treated Harlan.  Actually most of the characters came across as smart mouth and egotistical and that was a bit of a turn off.

This is my first male erotica by her and I was not disappointed.  This book is scorchingly intense from the word go. If your pulse isn't racing at the end of Chapter 1, you may want to check that you actually have one. Harlan, having exhausted all avenues to get his professor, Sawyer, to see him as anything but a student, sends him a sexy home video the very night he graduates.  Sawyer, having denied his feelings for years, finally admits defeat but has no interest in submitting quietly.  He's determined to show Harlan that the quiet, even keeled professor that Harlan has come to know is anything but laid back in the bedroom. Keep a cold drink closeby because you will need it. Once they give into their desires, the loving is hot and  heavy.  But in between the fiery sex scenes are two people overcoming societal labels(professor/student) and making missteps as they navigate their new relationship.  Harlan's job as an exotic dancer adds fuel to the fire and a whole different element to their relationship. This book is pretty much flawless, IMO.

This is very different from the ""There can only be Two"" Sith culture, which makes sense since they missed the whole rise of Darth Bane, the Sith Lord that founded the rule of two.This short story, The Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice, is the back story on how the Sith ended up on the planet Kesh.  Set 5000 years before time of The Fate of the Jedi we are introduced to a galaxy full of Sith.  If you plan of reading TFOTJ: Omen, this will give you insight into some of the most interesting and complex villians to inhabit the Star Wars expanded universe in some time.  I am guessing there will be several short books in this series, each timed to gather interest in the Fate of the Jedi stories.  Far from being just a publicity vehicle I found the story intriging and engaging.  It adds to the legend of some of the baddest guys in the galaxy, the Sith.  I look forward to the next stories in this clever series.Omen (Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi, Book 2)","09 26, 2009",A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,Timothy B.

But he is so scared of that side of himself he's always hidden it.Lily on the other hand has only known pleasure with punishment as that is what her husband showed her. She sees that in Hale and is determined to be his, and to please him.In short, if you are looking for a quick short read that will steam up your ereader then pick this up, you won't regret it.

I get a little frustrated with all the comments about editing during reviews, maybe we should start critiquing the art work on the cover next.

This means that we get the freshness of new authors, some of them so determined to get their story out that they will type it out on a phone.  That is just so cool to me.

The story resembled something  written for young teens, the characters flat, the story rushed. Luckily I was bored  and had nothing else to read so i stuck with it. Once they got out of the building the character's personalities grew as did the story. It bloomed out dragging you along by introducing a new form of  ""smart"" zombies but kept the ""shamblers"". The ""Smart"" zombies kept their thoughts and personality from before they were changed, grew smarter, could talk and became stronger the more they fed, and the ""shamblers"" were just your traditional stupid, non talking ""brainnnnnns"" type. Even though i am a die hard ""brainnnnns"" fan, I liked the new smart zombies. I liked how it showed the story from the zombies point of view. It was more of ""evolution"" than a ""invasion"" of zombies. Its about time zombies became as smart as vampires and take their place as something that could form its own society to feed off the weaker humans. Its soooo nice to see them as something other than a monster to just fear and bash their heads in. I can see great possibilities for the story to grow out to a new world order type thing where the zombies become the dominate species and humans battle for a spot to live and not be food.The typos and mis-labeled/named characters were distracting and confusing. There is a part where Nancy is slapping Jimbo and it says Fred. I had to read that section several times to understand it.

It still has the shambling zombies, but the story also contains ""smart"" zombies. Each time a zombie feeds it regenerates and gets stronger and smarter. Also some zombies had some pings of humanity. I do not usually like this in my stories. I usually really like the old fashion romero type zombies, but the author did a good job with it so it did work for me. Not bad for an independent book.

The human survivors in the Zombie Chronicles world therefore have to content with both types of zombies as they try to survive.The first three Zombie Chronicles books center upon Max, his best friend Bill, a cop Jane Steward, and a great supporting cast of minor characters -- both human and zombie.  Interesting questions are raised:  Can a thinking zombie still care about humanity?  Could zombie and human work together to overcome the common evil?  What qualifies as humanity?  There are some grammatical mistakes in the series, particularly in the first book, but for me those faded in significance as I was caught up in the unique ""smart zombies"" premise, the multidimensional characters (it was particularly interesting to see the world through the eyes of the smart zombies), and the action as Max and friends try to stay alive.In book one, Outbreak, Max meets his first zombie at the office, and fights his way home to his family.","07 20, 2011",A3DN2PISIG14C6,C.

There may be a sentence structure or grammatical error that the author didn't make, but I think he managed to hit them all.  The author has no idea where to use a comma - he doesn't have them where they're supposed to be, and apparently inserts them completely at random elsewhere, as I could detect no pattern. He also throws in the occasional semicolon just to expand the range of punctuation marks he uses incorrectly.He uses almost no contractions, which makes the narrative and dialog even more  stilted, contrived and clunky.When he's not using cliches, his original descriptive phrases are astonishing in their badness: 'The homeless man slowly put one uneasy foot in front of the other...', a zombie's wrist broke 'with a thunderous crunching sound', and a building had 'outside entrances, almost like a massive cancerous duplex gone wrong.'Really?The characters are without exception cartoony and one-dimensional, the character development non existent, and the action sequences contrived and unrealistic.The zombies retain self-awareness and rational thought, possess magic zombie-vision, have many vampire-like traits, and can pass for normal humans.I was ready to quit at 25%, but I read through the whole thing to see if it would eventually get better - or at least less bad.  It never did, and in the end it just got 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' stupid.If the author wants to write a series, he'd be well advised to take several high school level English grammar and composition courses, a creative writing course, and get himself a copy of Strunk & White.

There's a war most of us heard of and a few minutes in the miserable life of one, anonymous actor, or warrior. The charming part, and this is what earns the story its stars is the easy, smooth, almost imperceptible transition from what appears in the beginning to be 'historical fiction' to what turns out to be something completely different.I stated in my review that this is only a teaser not because I know for a fact that it is but because I can't see any other reason why the story would be written. ""In the Trenches"" could stands its own in the pages of Analog or, better, the ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" magazine but, even there, the readers would be unhappy if they learned that this wasn't the precursor of some large, expansive series of works mapping that strange universe for our wonderment and reading pleasure.Based on the teaser, I'd buy the 'big book' if and when it comes out.","05 31, 2009",ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A.

Tension is well built. The impending doom of a battle is clear in the language. The author does a comendable job of creating the rules for the ensuing battle.There is an inflection point where the mages are introduced, the story goes south for a number of paragraphs. The word mage is repeated a lot. The repitition is abrupt compared to the introductory paragraphs where the author chose words very carefully with little repetition. More fantasy words are used and then it becomes clearer, this is real battle combined with a fantasy land battle. Although I hesitate to say fantasy, because this could also be viewed as how Marten copes with the horror around him; although not real, he sees the mages, zombies, and dragons as if they are real.Fortunately the story recovers very nicely and flows into a comprehensible and vivid description of the battle. Once the author settles into the type of phrasing from the early paragraphs, the story regains its power.This is an interesting blending of styles, historical and fantasy. Aside from the transition point, a very well written, visual account that is an engaging read.","06 9, 2009",A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,Daniel G. Lebryk,Good,1244505600

Lief is devastated to learn that the mastermind behind this attack was his intended, Katla Rollodottir. In the midst of this turmoil and devastation, he is thrown overboard only to wash upon the shores of sunny California...present day California, of course. When he opens his eyes he is furious at the sight before him. It is none other than Katla, the woman who brutally betrayed him.Kat Jonsdottir is shocked to find this stunningly gorgeous Viking on the beach, but even more startled when he tries to kill her! She quickly strives to make Lief understand he has traveled to another time and that she is not the woman who betrayed him, but rather a descendant of the infamous Katla. Both are confused by what exactly has happened, but know they have no choice except to find a way for Lief to return home. Along the way they discover their lives and their future are tied very closely together...not to mention the stunning attracting that is pulling them together in more romantic ways. Now they must discover if they have the answers for Lief's escape and if these two time crossed lovers can live without each other.Under A Viking Moon is an authentic and thrilling romance that travels to the ends of the earth with two unbreakable characters. Leif's character acclimated extremely well to Kat's time in the first half of this novel. In any time travel novel, it is always fun to see the hero dropped into this new present day world and completely baffled by the world around him. Leif was no different and you could tell he felt awkward at first, but quickly fell into step. In Kat's time, or present day, I found him to be a very delicious and like-able hero. He was the guy willing to cut down any man in his way to save his beloved Kat and it was heroically romantic. He was stellar Viking any girl would swoon for! The secondary characters in this period had such an enjoyable time with the blossoming couple, and I really enjoyed the playful manner between them all.You could easily divide this Under A Viking Moon into two parts: the first half in Kat's time and the second in Leif's time. The second half of the novel is where the problems began for me. Kat and Leif had so much fun in the first half it was a delight to read. The second half though became drastically dark and a bit overwhelming after reading the first. On the one hand, I thought it stayed truthful to the time period but on the other hand I thought it somewhat killed the romance. Dee is spot on with her historical accuracy which is part of the reason why the novel was so dark by the end and understandably so. For me though, I thought Leif and Kat had much better chemistry in modern time and the shifts in time periods really were just too much of a dramatic change. The hero had a pretty drastic attitude change going from one time period to another and I felt it was not for the better. It seemed as though the hero was reluctant to make any sacrifices for our heroine and was more loyal to keeping up appearances for his clan.I did enjoy the set up behind Under A Viking Moon and for the most part the characters were great together and a joy to read about. The world building was perfect, being gritty where it should be gritty or carefree and fun where it needed to be carefree and fun. This novel is a grand adventure and will fit the bill for the right reader.So after all is said and done this is just a personal opinion. I know there are readers out there that appreciate the angst and intensity their hero and heroine have to work through in order to reach there happy ending. If you are one of those readers, I can guarantee you this is the book for you. You will enjoy the emotional roller coaster of ups and downs in this novel.

I can't begin to tell you how many things bugged me about this story. Besides the atrocious spelling and grammar, the plot and characters were just plain silly. Kat went from being obnoxious (which obviously translated to strength) to being a victim (which somehow translated to softness and a resilient spirit). The dialogue was terrible. Leafy boy? Buster?Seriously does anyone talk like that?There is also the glaring fact that a 21st century woman kept excusing absolutely heinous actions by her new warm and fuzzy slave-trading, child-murdering, woman-raping family because they didn't make her sleep with the other livestock (read: people).As far as I'm concerned, coercing her into having sex before he told her that she wouldn't be allowed to keep her child was just another example of what a great guy Leif was. At every opportunity to believe in her, her ""husband"" failed but in Kat's mind that was all right because, apparently when you've got piercing blue eyes and a six-pack, you can squeeze your wife's face so hard she cries and it's taken as a sign of what a passionate, conflicted, deep man you are. Am I the only one who wondered what happened to the plotline of Kat being erased from existence if her ancestor was killed? Leif was such a strong leader that he quaked in his buckskin boots every time he thought his warriors might think he wasn't tough? And where, oh where, did the ancient Norse get potatoes??

In order to get some cash to spring her Ted teams up with Jerry for an assignment from the AABC an unofficial branch of the government.  The assignment is to get the boomerang... but so many things can go wrong with such a simple assignment.  Things like a crazy pair of Australian sisters, an insane assassin who carries a crossbow, a cheerleader who rarely wears clothes, and a senator or two.

Silent Blade made the list.Meli and Celino were both defined and restrained by who their families were. What it meant to be kin, the sacrifices you had to make to keep the family strong. I'm also fairly certain that neither of them had families worth sacrificing for, but that's just my opinion.The world that Andrews creates is brutal and devestating and neither of them are completely innocent. Its dog eat dog, where ruthlessness will win you more brownie points then mercy. This isn't to say they are evil doers killing the innocent and such, but they have a certain pragmatic viewpoint of the world. You hurt mine, I'll hurt you.Meli's revenge is poetic and says much about who she is. I'm not entirely certain why her family put the hit on Celino--I doubt they waited 12 years to administer payback for what he did to Meli--as that was a gray area unexplored. Meli didn't question it, her father and brother weren't offering the reason and no one seemed overly concerned if Meli turned it into a personal vendetta against Celino.I'd be lying if I didn't say I wanted to read more about this world of theirs--where its practically Mafialand in the future, but this small taste proved again why Ilona Andrews should be a must buy for anyone and everyone.","11 15, 2009",AD3R2M2DT2BY3,"Amazon Customer ""Poisoned Rationality""",Silent Blade,1258243200

Really, they're simply Ilona Andrews withdrawals because I just am ten different ways in love with the way they write a world. I know going in to expect to be amazed, delighted, and--above all and thank the high heavens--entertained. Whether its shapeshifters and magic waves, overlapping dimensions and backwoods feuds, or futuristic assassins and genetically enhanced mafiosi--it is guaranteed to get my bibliophilic heart pumping and I can't tell you how much I look forward to each encounter. This is a good year because we get two full-length novels in two excellent worlds and, having already downedMagic Bleeds, I found myself looking ahead longingly to September and the release ofBayou Moon. And then it occurred to me that I'd never gotten around to reading SILENT BLADE, the novella published last year from Samhain. I'm not sure how it slipped past me, but I immediately purchased it, downloaded it to my nook, and dropped offline for the evening.Meli Galdes is ready for retirement. Having served her family for more than a decade as a lone assassin, she's planning on hanging up her spurs and falling off the grid completely. Then her father calls in one more favor and it involves a man Meli thought she'd never see again. Celino Carvanna is responsible for the life of danger and isolation Meli leads. Years ago their lives were intertwined and then, in the space of a heartbeat, the connection was severed and Celino went on to monumental success and power, while Meli walked away from everything and everyone she ever knew, shaping herself into an elite (and secret) weapon. Now, on the cusp of retirement, she's asked to take on this one last job. For her family. One last hit to round out her career on a high and oh-so-satisfying note. Then she'll be able to put it all behind her and see about creating another kind of life for herself. But it's been a long time since she knew what made this ruthless businessman tick, an even longer time since she cared. Neither of them are who they once were. And so she sets about remembering every detail, pulling up every familiar quirk and distant memory, so that when she finally comes face to face with Celino once more, she will be ready. She won't hesitate. She'll know just what to do. And, as is the case with all her targets, he won't even know what hit him.I don't think I realized going in that this novella was science fiction. What a pleasant surprise that was! Set in a futuristic society, in which a cadre of powerful families--known as the Kinsmen--rule a world built upon the basis of their particular biological enhancements, SILENT BLADE pelts out of the starting gate with gusto. Meli is established right of the bat as a woman who has honed her skills and is the best at what she does. She flies solo and completely under the radar and I loved her from page one. As her history becomes clearer, I found myself utterly on her side and very much in favor of her meting out whatever punishment necessary on the heartless Celino. What can I say? I'm always up for a vengeance quest, especially when the person on the hunt is so justified and awesome and, well, adept when it comes to the actual punishing. Then the point of view switched, and I was forced to walk a few paces in Celino's shoes. And while I was still on Meli's side, I admit it--I was curious. Curious to see how he'd react when all was revealed. Curious to see if Meli's resolve went the distance. I loved the wild swirl of color and scent and taste running through this world. Meli loves each of these things and, while she's voluntarily put them aside in the service of her family, there are hints of them here and there, even in the ascetic existence she embodies. This is romantic science fiction a la Linnea Sinclair and Ann Aguirre and, though it is a shorter work and wraps up nicely, I would happily read much larger and longer doses were they available. Meli is very much her own woman and I really think there's plenty of fodder here for many more stories. Perhaps one day we'll get them. In the meantime, if you're an Andrews fan, I highly recommend SILENT BLADE. You won't be disappointed","08 2, 2010",A3RSRLZ271Q81S,"Angela Thompson ""Angiegirl""",Angieville: SILENT BLADE,1280707200

The author gave just the right amount of description in order to help the readers understand the Kinsmen world, and she did it without info dumping or sounding tedious.I also like her characters, especially Meli who is the quintessential strong woman, and who rose from the ashes of her vulnerability and past pain without turning hard, enabling me to sympathize with her. I like that Meli didn't immediately fly into Celino's arms when he declared his feelings for her, as had happened in so many books I have read in the past. To the end, Meli was her own woman, forged in the fire of her experiences and the situations life--or people--has dealt her.

I wasn't sure how I'd like such a bleak and harsh world, but Ilona Andrews does a marvelous job at pitting the characters against their world.

I had the best intentions of doing so, but I used its shorter format as a justification for the delay. (""It's just a short story."") Which, no, it's actually a novella, an important difference. Not smart guys, not smart. Have I not read every Kate Daniels and Edge novel by Ilona Andrews and been entertained by their uncanny knack for incredible worldbuilding Every. Single. Time? And they did it again, and it was even a meaner feat because Silent Blade is not a full-length novel. After wasting away for months on my Kindle, I finally opened it standing in line for Bitterblue at BEA this year, and the wait time flew by.Did I mention that I couldn't put Silent Blade down? Later at the MoMA, I cut into my visit in order to finish it. Meli and Celino's turbulent past and unknown future are just that impossible to ignore. Fans of antagonism to attraction romances will feel at home here. Best of all, Meli's myriad reasons for wanting Celino to die by the fire of a thousand suns are completely warranted. There is no easy resolution for reconciliation, let alone for these two to become a couple. Nevertheless, there are some seriously hot moments for Meli and Celino, and for those who are familiar with Ilona Andrews, Silent Blade is more along the lines of The Edge novels than the Kate Daniels series romance-wise, which is at times more spelled out than I'd like. As always, the space colonized world is both effortless to grasp and rich in every detail. I loved the vivid, touchable, and atmospheric setting of New Delphi. I have not forgotten the conjured images of colorful flowers, heady scents, and earthy architecture.  I understand why the leap in time at the resolution was necessary to the plot but in a shorter format, it felt abrupt. (Perhaps I just wanted more?)

They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question. And one you will only get the answer to by . . . wait for it . . . yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;READING the book. *winsome face*Verdict: a quick, fun, and SEXY read. Yes, I know it&#8217;s Ilona Andrews, and yes, I know that fabulous as she is, she&#8217;s not particularly well known for sexy times, but there&#8217;s a first for everything, right?

I would've liked if the authors gave a brief recount of why earth is now the ""old earth"" and what led up to the change.  I was disappointed in the old time view on a women's worth and arranged marriages.  The heroine was wishy-washy and a pathetic excuse of a women who let's a guy walk all over her, an undeserving and immature guy at that.  For being so far into the future and technologically advanced, the book's society seemed no better than our ancestors of 500 years ago.  In truth, this story focused more on the character's relationship than the potentially exciting world the Ilona Andrews team could've built.  The sex took up a lot of this novella and it was mediocre at best, and clearly one of the two duo has a breast fetish.I love the Ilona Andrews duo, their Kate Daniels series is exceptional and the Edge series, while more romance oriented than I usually like, is still fantastic!  Never would've thought I'd be rating any of their books this low, but.......here we are.To my fellow dark urban fantasy readers, regardless of my gripes this novella had some rays of interest and wasn't entirely bad, but it wasn't engaging and spellbinding either.  I don't think you'd be missing anything if you skipped this, however, if you do indeed read this novella I offer a forewarning.

It is also more of a romance than either of her other series.Meli has retired from her work as an energy wielding assassin.  Then her Family asks one more thing of her...to assassinate the man that ruined her life.  The story is set in a futuristic world where Mafia-like families maintain order and humans have been biological engineered to be exceptional.This isn't a long book, it's a novella.  Despite this fact Andrews does an excellent job creating a believable world and engaging characters.  She give the characters wonderful history and wonderful chemistry.  The writing, as usual, is incredibly engaging and a joy to read.There is some action in this book, but it is mostly a story of two characters at odds with their worlds.  The romance aspect is much stronger in this story than in other books from Andrews, and the sex scenes much more explicit.  I am not huge on romance and prefer action, but I really enjoyed reading this book.  I fell in love with the characters and was on the edge of my set just hoping for a happy ending.The story ends well too.

I was not disappointed!Meli Galdes is ready to retire from her position as an assassin for her family, but they want her to do one more job: kill the man who broke her heart and ruined her life, forcing her into excise (basically she was publicly considered a leper to her family though she did their dirty work). Celino Carvanna broke Meli's heart when she was young in a callous way, but that's not what destroyed Meli. She could forgive his youth. He took away her freedom with his actions and even though he hadn't realized what he'd done in that aspect (can't say what without giving away spoilers) she still wanted him to pay for what he'd done, though not in the way her family wanted so she could truly be free of him.Both Meli and Celino are products of a harsh society and I like that their actions and decisions weren't glossed over. Meli was an assassin but she had a moral code and a soft side. And while Celino was a brutal businessman and an all out dangerous man, he was very tender with her. This was a very emotional story and the ending wasn't immediately wrapped up with a neat bow which I liked. They had to work for their happy ending. For such a short story, this author packed an incredible emotional punch so even though the ending was a little abrupt, it whet my appetite for more from this interesting world.","12 29, 2011",A3BIER4C0FG6S7,Marie,Big emotional punch in a small package,1325116800

4766,B002BX87E0,"[4, 4]",3,"3.5 stars for this short, enjoyable, explicit romance.  Tropes include revenge, abandonment, and insta-love. It's cloaked as science fiction, but it's ROMANCE. As such, it's just fine, but I much prefer Andrews' straight-up urban fantasies. It's not that I dislike romance -- sometimes that's exactly what I want (but not from Team Andrews).This is book 1 of the Kinsmen series. Book 2 is out, too. My main problem with Silent Blade is the insta-love trope. It didn't work for me, so then the sex didn't move me either. The relationship development relied on sex too much, maybe? I am guessing the length (42 pages) constrained the authors.Setting: Another world, inhabited by humans with special implants and ruled by a few different  Kinsman  or  Kin  families who have special inborn powers. (Think Mafia families ruling their financial empires, killing off the competition.)Characters: The hero (Celino Carvannas) is a rich and ruthless Kinsman, good with knives, 32 years old, ""tall, lean, and overwhelmingly masculine"" (of course). The heroine (Meli Galdes) is an outcast Kinsman, excised from her family, and -- because of her ability to slay instantly with an energy ribbon -- she has become a world-class assassin.Plot: Meli's family asked her to do one last killing for them (even though she's been excised for 12 years, she still does their dirty work??) Celino is the target. We are never told exactly WHY they want him dead, but I suppose it's because his business is outperforming their business.But there's a twist to this assassination assignment. She knows her target. She was only 10 when their joint parents, seeking to combine power, arranged for the two to become engaged. He was 16. She studied him, as a good wife-in-waiting should do in this feudal society, and in the course of learning, she crushed, pinning all her hopes and dreams on him. But at age 22 (to her 16) he broke the engagement -- not kindly or tactfully at all -- causing her to become untouchable, an outcast, eventually an assassin.When they meet again 12 years later he doesn't recognize her, because she was always veiled in the past. Insta-luv! He strode into the kitchen in the restaurant, smelled her passion cones (talkin' biscuits!), saw her lush curves, met her rich coffee-brown eyes...After he left, Meli smiled with satisfaction. ""It took almost 18 years, from the skinny 10-year-old girl to the 28-year old woman, but Mother proved right. She hit him like a brick.""So....will she kill him, or won't she? Will he figure out that she's the girl he tossed to the curb? If so, will he suffer and grovel?  (I do like a good grovel).Not much action. Minimal suspense. Not much to make it qualify as sci-fi or paranormal. This is a romance novel, with explicit sex and several  references to honey and breasts. The language is clean. Not much violence. Nothing gory.","12 6, 2012",A15IRM5PNJUKP7,Mountaineer,A romance on another world,1354752000

I found myself wishing Gregory could have found another mate besides Ryland who was tri omega and Viktor who was the second mate .

Once again, I was drawn into this small family and into their lives and loves.Ryland was beaten almost to death by his birth pack for being small and weak and then they left him to die. Unbeknownst to them and his new pack, Ryland is a Tri-Omega which means when he gets claimed by both of his mates he'll be able to shift and he will come into his powers. From the moment Gregory rescues him, Ryland knows they're mates, he's just been waiting patiently to be claimed.Gregory has done everything possible for six years to not claim Ryland. He's been waiting for him to come of age and be ready. So, when his Alpha's mate, Leyland, allows Gregory to see into Ry's heart and he realizes how much Ry is ready to be claimed and be his mate, Gregory wastes no time and claims him. Unfortunately, Gregory didn't listen when Leyland told him that Ry is &#34;just like&#34; Leyland, meaning he's a Tri-Omega and will have two mates. So now that Gregory has claimed him, they have a limited amount of time to locate Ry's other mate or he could die.Enter Viktor, Beta to another pack that Gregory and Ryland meet while on vacation. Viktor isn't so sure about this whole Tri-Omega thing and he's positive he doesn't want to have to share his mate. That's part of what makes this book so very different from the first story. Here there's literally three people who have to acclimate to each other on an intimate level instead of being lovers for awhile already.I liked this story as it was fairly unique. Ryland ends up with some very interesting powers and with the two men he loves. There is a little drama, but nothing earth shattering. If you like shifter stories, multiple men, and hot, smexy fun, then this is a good read and a good series for you.","08 10, 2013",AR9RKLQQC2L6K,CCDuke,Forbidden Desires,1376092800

Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn he may lose him.  To Gregory, Ryland has always been special, but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him.Ryland didn't understand all of the ramifications of being a tri-omega, all he knew was that he loved Gregory and wanted nothing more than to have Gregory claim him.  Being claimed by Gregory was everything Ryland dreamed it to be, but his dream may come to an end when he and Gregory discover that their happily ever after depends on someone they never met.Forbidden Desires was a good follow up book in the Tri-Omega Mates series.  I loved Ryland from the previous book and adored him even more in Forbidden Desires.  I wasn't crazy about some of the secondary characters but Ryland, Gregory and Viktor, the man who completed their relationship, made Forbidden Desires a very enjoyable read.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","11 15, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Forbidden Desires,1258243200

Yet there is a nice little plot interweaved  that is thoroughly enjoyable and allows you to convince yourself you're not just reading smut. *grin* Good characters, nice story, happy ending.Aside:The Badlands books are written by ""Elle Saint James"" but looking around it appears this is a pseudonym. Does this matter? Probably not. And I'm not going to say who I believe it is, 'cause that would be telling... Okay, it's not difficult to work out but where would the fun be in that? If an author writes under multiple names, there's usually a reason. Often the author is testing a different voice, or a different genre. In this case I suspect she is using it to delve into the cowboy menage genre (not really featured under her other name). And ""Elle Saint James"" is an excellent name for Wild West author.

The story starts out with Logan & Derrick waiting at the train station for their mail-order bride that they specifically picked named Miranda, now this is the seventh day and she still hasn't shown and neither one wants to go back to their ranch without her. Finally after about two hours of waiting the train whistle can be heard, the guys are anxiously awaiting when the train pulls up and several people get off and leave but no Miranda. So when the conductor gets off they ask him and he says, &#34;I don't know, but I'm in a hurry to fetch the sheriff because at the last bridge a young woman jumped off the train, while we were moving very fast. According to a young woman behind the conductor it was in fact Miranda who jumped. Just great now what are we supposed to do, we don't have a wife now! Clarissa felt bad for these two guys they were both very good looking but very different, one was dark haired and one was light haired she hoped her intended was as good looking as these two. While she was deep in thought the lawyer Jasper who brought her out for Clyde came around the bend, and said I'm sorry Clarissa your intended couldn't wait for you and he got married a couple of days ago, &#34;What am I supposed to do now&#34; I have no money and I can't go back to New York. Logan piped up, hey we don't have a bride either how about you spend the day with us and see if you would like to marry me. Jasper got all indignant and said &#34;no you don't want to get involved with these two they are looking for something different&#34;, Derick said be quite Jasper let the lady decide. In the mean time Derick moved in close to Clarissa and said if you marry Logan you get me as your husband as well, she looked up shocked, but thought about it and said okay I'll spend the day with you. So as they started to walk away, she said okay I'll marry you, so they stopped at the church and Logan married Clarissa and she became Mrs. Granger.

All he has to do is dance with a woman once and rumors begin flying fast and furious all over the ton.  No father would allow him within touching distance of a virginal daughter which is why it's stunning when he leaves a crowded ballroom only to find the engaged reigning beauty of the haute ton awaiting him in his carriage.Lady Helen Richmond, daughter of the Earl of Charbeau, is on a mission.  Her father has betrothed her to a man not of her choosing and refuses to listen to her objections to the match.  She's taking matters into her own hands and has decided to proposition `Wicked Warrick.'  She has no doubt that the arrogant Duke of Resdale will no longer want her if she's ruined and she's sincerely counting on Wade to come to the rescue in her time of need.Wade isn't one for indiscriminate sex and he certainly isn't comfortable deflowering a virgin.  He believes that one should feel something for a woman besides lust before taking her to his bed.  Helen's proposition is shocking - and oddly enough she isn't expecting marriage and in fact insists that she'd like to keep their association a secret.  Helen's put a lot of thought into her decision to approach Wade and the simple fact that he's never shown any interest in her is a huge plus.  If he'd been one of her many admirers then their `association' would result in being forced to marry and that holds no appeal to her.After much discussion, Wade realizes that he is attracted to Helen and saying no to her is practically impossible.  Helen is stunned that Wade requires so much convincing - after all wouldn't a rake be overjoyed at the idea of sex without any expectations?  Fortunately, Wade does agree to bed her and the experience is better than Helen ever dared to hope.Now that Helen's been `ruined' she's safe from the unwanted marriage but now she's craving more time with Wade.  She knows that there's no possibility of anything more permanent with Wade but there's nothing wrong with a few stolen moments - or hours, is there?  Wade's assured her that he's not a rake but surely a man so skilled in bed has been with more women than he's letting on.  Things get a little more complicated when she begins experiencing signs of pregnancy - and there's the attack on Wade.  Wade and Helen are sure that her ex-fianc&eacute; is behind the incident but can they prove it?Emma Wildes' historicals are always a pleasure to read.  The characters are strong and brilliantly depicted so that readers are quickly caught up in their plights.  CAN'T SAY NO is the third book in THE IMPROPER LADIES series and it's a fabulous addition to Ms. Wildes' booklist.  Helen's determination to be `ruined' and Wade's disbelief at her plea drew me into the storyline but it's the passion and desire between them that kept me enchanted by their story.

The setting is interesting and the alliances for the upcoming war prove the author spent some time with world building.Most of the &#34;plot twists&#34; were easy for me to predict. This isn't unusual. I'm a writer and a voracious reader. If you can trick me and have the proper groundwork in place to back up your twist, I'm impressed.For me, the allegory is too plain here. It isn't preachy yet, but I suspect it might become that way before the series is finished. Of course, this makes me want to check out the next book to see if I'm right.While this first installment in the series does seem to have a story problem that is resolved (find the wielder) it isn't the main character's problem. His problem is feeling like an outcast in his home reality and I guess that is resolved in the story. It seems pretty easily resolved to me. The plot is strong for the story but the character arc is weak.If you like quests, magic, elves, dragons and battle scenes, you will probably enjoy this book.

Sarah challenges the clan leader's wife to a fight that is supposed to be to the death, or if the loser surrenders, she and her family must leave the town forever.

She's spent the intervening years getting over the heartache.  She thought she'd been successful at exorcizing him from her heart but his appearance at the Margarita Andresen Foundation fundraiser proves that she's still in love with him.  She's as much in love with him now as she ever was, but there's no way she's going to put herself through the pain of trusting him with her heart again.  Not even for the sizeable donation he's offering for her undivided attention while he's in New York.Demetrius Vartolas is a proud man who's well aware he made a huge error when he accused Crystal of cheating on him three years ago.  His jealousy got the better of him and he spoke without thoroughly examining the evidence and lost the woman he loves.  While he'd like nothing better than for Crystal to welcome him back with open arms, reality is that he hurt her and if he hopes to have any chance of rekindling their relationship he'll have to use any opportunity open to him - and her dedication to the Foundation proves to be the most convenient way to ensure she spends time with him.Crystal's stunned when she notices Demetrius's appearance at the Foundation's fundraiser.  Because of his status as one of the world's wealthiest and most eligible bachelors his presence at any event guarantees it to be a success but that doesn't make the situation any more tolerable for Crystal.  With a bit of champagne for courage she hopes to make it through the evening unscathed.  Unfortunately that isn't to be because she's soon confronted by Demetrius's partner and best friend Makis Stratus who always seems to be just paces away from Demetrius's side.  She's never trusted the man and his superior attitude has only cemented her dislike of him.Demetrius's timely interruption of her verbal sparring with Makis could be construed as a blessing or disastrous since she's now forced to acknowledge his presence and the feelings she still has for him.  When Demetrius offers to donate whatever is needed to secure the foundation's finances for the next five years in exchange for her undivided attention for a few days Crystal's sorely tempted to take him up on the offer.  If he already believes her to be untrustworthy and unfaithful why would he want to spend any time at all with her?  For Crystal, it's a simple matter of reveling in the passion they once shared, but as her feelings are brought to the surface so are questions about the `proof' of her infidelity.  How will she react when she uncovers the truth behind the `evidence?'Brandi Michaels certainly doesn't mince words in her short story JEALOUS LOVER.  Crystal and Demetrius's engagement was ripped apart by jealousy and insecurities but it's obvious that there's still a lot of love between them.  This story is sexually charged and intense right from the beginning but there are plenty of emotional connections that allow readers to enjoy every aspect of this couple's relationship - whether fighting or loving.  Ms. Michaels delves into the heartache over a broken engagement and betrayal and brings readers a story that will leave them smiling.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","08 10, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

4850,B002CZQ7XK,"[0, 1]",3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book but it wasn't all that original.  The writing was good, which is something I've come to treasure in today's market, when anyone can publish their poorly written slop without much difficulty and even best selling authors from major publishing houses are suffering a lack of editing.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal/Gothic romance.If you're not looking for characters with depth or a plot with surprising twists, you'll probably enjoy this book.There were two things that I didn't like.  (SPOILER ALERT!)  First, the way the love scenes were written gave me the impression that this author isn't really comfortable writing about sex.  When the hero and heroine made love for the first time, the tone suddenly became weirdly formal, with lines like ""It seemed imperative that their bodies meet without hindrance..."" which sort of killed the mood for me.  There were also so many flagrant metaphors (""He stirred her...like waves of a storm""; ""They poised on the edge of a volcano..."") that I totally missed the ghostly elements during that scene because I thought it was just more metaphor.  It was only at the end of the scene, when the characters started talking about what had just happened, that I even understood what the author was trying to portray.Second, I'm a retired professional musician who also has a degree in psychology, and unfortunately, this author tried to portray both a musician character and a character who suffers mental problems without doing enough research into either area.  Most people who lack my background might not notice, but for me, these flaws were glaring.  I'm not certain how this author came up with her information, but it was both inaccurate and outdated.  I realize it's nerdy to expect writers to do a little basic research before they start typing, but this kind of sloppiness tends to ruin books for me.  I can handle a bit of poetic license, but this went beyond that, straight into the realm of lazy disregard for plausibility.One other complaint: most ebooks allow the reader to jump between chapters.  This one didn't, making it very difficult to move through the book if I wanted to go back and check something I'd read before--something I often do while reading a book which involves some sort of mystery.  This really annoyed me, more than the occasion errors in the formatting did.If you're not too picky and don't expect too much, you'll probably enjoy this book.

For example, Sarah is a very strong woman but innocent at the same time.  It's the way the author puts these together that I find interesting.  I liked the fact that there was a good plot and many surprises.  For someone who likes this kind of book, I highly recommend it.","07 16, 2012",AX1HJDWN7D46F,authorpholloway,authorpholloway,1342396800

Unfortunately, I couldn't remember the title or the author; all I could remember was there was a Native American girl named Sara who was a shape-shifter, an investigator, and a parrot.  I could never find the book.  Then I went on the internet, put in the key words, and there it was on Amazon!  My second reading was as good as my first.  If you love a good mystery/suspense novel with supernatural overtones and excellent character development, then this is the book for you.  Sara is disarmingly charming.  Everyone in the book (well, almost everyone) falls in love with her, and you will, too.  Expertly written and captivating; this book leaves you wanting more.  I am so glad I continued my search.

4859,B002D48L3E,"[3, 4]",5,"Lee Driver's The Good Die Twice is the start of an extraordinary new mystery series featuring Chase Dagger and his Native American partner Sara Morningsky. Combining Native American tradition with the guts and gore of a  solid murder mystery, The Good Die Twice is certainly at the top of my best  books list.  Five years ago wealthy Robert Tyler's wife disappeared and  is presumed dead. Her body was never found. Five years after Rachel Tyler's  disappearance, Sara Morningsky, a Native American 18-year-old with the gift  of the ability to shapeshift into either a hawk or a wolf, witnesses a  mysterious woman's murder in the present. When she attends a social event  with Chase Dagger, Sara recognizes the woman on the wall as the mysterious  woman she saw brutally murdered.  Sara could not report the murder to  the police since a shapeshifter could never be convincing. When she drags  Dagger to the crime scene, they find a black, possibly topaz, earring the  size of at least fifty carats. Little do they suspect the danger the have  let themselves in for, or the dangerous story behind the earring presumed  to belong to the murder victim.  With a creative ingenuity seldom  matched, Driver presents the reader with the sexy, mysterious,  thirty-year-old Dagger and his perfect counterpoint Sara. Combine them with  the rowdy Einstein, a scarlet macaw with an incredible memory. Add Dagger's  fianc&eacute;e wanna-be, a woman with a talent for clothes and the inability to  accept that Dagger won't marry her. Complete the mix with Skizzy, the  paranoid schizophrenic with a talent for creating legal documents. The  results are a suspenseful blend that will leave readers clamoring for more.  Driver also writes as the extraordinary Sandra Tooley, the author of  When The Dead Speak and Nothing Else Matters. This author's fresh approach  to crime-fiction, with an overlay of the mystical that doesn't stifle but  enlivens is a rare blend of Native American tradition and crime-fiction  guaranteed to satisfy.Cindy Penn, Reviewer","06 6, 2000",A14OJS0VWMOSWO,Midwest Book Review,Very Highly Recommended,960249600

He is an avid reader of reading and watching anything related to mystery; books, movies and television series. The book ""The Classmate Murders"" follows this older in body than mind, gentleman who leads a simple and somewhat boring life until he receives a disturbing e-mail from a high school classmate. She was actually an ex-girlfriend of his who was now afraid that someone wanted to take her life. Unfortunately, he receives that message too late and she is found dead with the message that there will be more murders to come. With his good friend Buck, Jim decides to use his learned investigation skills, no matter how limited, to try to solve the mystery before others are found dead. With team works so well together that the police seem to be one step behind them. Jim becomes an important part of the case, even with small matter he knows a little too much about the woman involved. He comes the conclusion that the women being threatened are cheerleaders from his high school. Who would want these women dead after forty years later and why.I must admit I didn't think that a story about a senior citizen wanna-be private investigator was going to be so entertaining, but was I wrong. This book proves that even an old dog can have a sharp mind to look at details and figure out leads to solve a difficult case.  With its  humor, and friendly banter between characters and with some steamy sexy scenes, this book packs a lot between its covers. Adults of any age would find the characters likable, the plot integrating, and will find it a great mystery. I liken it to a cup of tea brewed, not too hot and not too cold, sweet with a little honey with no need for the cream.","02 21, 2011",A2ME9BGLZ0AEBP,"michele tater ""Michele Tater""",Who says an old dog can't join the party?,1298246400
4924,B002D48NBO,"[2, 4]",5,"The Classmate Murders, by Bob Moat had me squirming deeper into my recliner and reaching for my bag of Oreos by the end of chapter one. Jim Richards, Moats fictional senior sluith, pulled me into his easy going, semi slothful life-style and made me feel comfortable and welcome in his parent's home, as he discovered that a classmate from forty years earlier had been murdered. Jim's  life of acceptance of growing old, and his prospects for the future not the best for a man his age, melted away in an instant of sentement and memory at the loss of his friend. Jim's mental gears start to turn slowly as he ponders why the dead person had reached out to him in her final moments of life: Him,the class nerd, him the shy unassuming class photographer, him, always invited, but never missed if he didn't show. A cunning and methodical mind is quickly revealed as he searches for answers. When the second classmate is murdered, Jim is up to his not-so-slim waist in mystery and intrigue, always two steps behind the murderer. When the body of a third friend shows up, Jim has picked up enough clues through bird dog tenacity,and a hound's sense of smelling out trouble,that he has a suspect in his sights and is zeroing in for the bust. Suddenly, the hunt turns and Jim is the target, possibly the next victim, or so he suspects, but the real target is the new love in his life, Penny, the girl that had a secret crush on Jim when they were in High School. Jim is caught off guard that such a beauty would have any interest in him, backin the day, and even now, when she reveals her long hidden secret of love for Jim. In spite of this new-found love late in life, Jim stays focused on finding the murderer. What happens next is close up tangles with the murderer, Shoot outs, high speed chases, close calls for Jim and Penny. The last chapter had me pacing my den floor, oreo crumbs trailed behind me, the sun peeking in through the closed blinds...thank God for sick days. By 9:00 A.M.

4925,B002D48NBO,"[0, 4]",1,"I am revising my review DOWN to one star, based on this author's responses to negative reviews, including mine. First he says he's not getting into ""a pissing contest"" with me, yet he had no trouble doing so with three or four other one-star reviewers (which he conveniently disremembers)...excuse me, one exception: He sicced his ""professional editor"" Sally Berneathy on Mr. Spadaro.Among one-star comments: ""reminded me of Nancy Drew...could have been written by a teenage girl,"" ""silly,"" ""makes no sense,"" ""dialogue is horrible,"" ""complete boredom,"" ""story is implausible,"" ""cheap and nasty,"" ""absolutely appalling,"" ""one dimensional as if a 13 year old wrote this,"" ""pedestrian,"" ""a first draft that appears to merit no further effort,"" ""bad grammar, syntax, punctuation...completely unrealistic characters, pages of pointless 'cute' banter that no one who has ever actually talked to an adult would dare call realistic,"" ""the text is simple, the plot is simple, the characters are simple,"" ""Moats should have paid me,"" ""who are these people that gave it a 4 or 5 star rating...I hope they don't live in my neighborhood,"" ""...even at this price (free) this book is a ripoff...who edited this? Someone's baby brother?"", ""reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,"" ""writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,"" ""writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,"" and Mr. Moats calls ME ""mean"". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.And the final nail: ""All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good."" AMEN.""Holy crap,"" he said, then put it between covers, titled it ""Classmate Murders"" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.Let me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be ""stupid"" and ""jerks"") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?And on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an ""unofficial civilian advisor""?And the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the ""closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation"" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.Another sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.That's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of ""Classmate Murders"".After reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist ""attributes"" is up to the reader to decide.About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% ""believable"" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, ""Vegas Show Girl Murders,"" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get ""Vegas"" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.For those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, ""has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being."");5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;8.) No cliffhanger ending;9.) Grammar and punctuation police, have at it, examples of what you will find:""She carefully taped the ends together and produced a nice spark."" (tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)""My curiosity was peaked.""""...but no one seems knows where.""*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER","05 30, 2014",AHJHPNS80A07K,mrsdepass,Author can't leave well enough alone,1401408000

Although it has a great plot and plenty of murder, it is deftly written with a light touch, with just the right blend of humor and mystery.  The characters are clearly defined and before you know it, you are along for the ride.What started as a freebie has become an obsession for me, as I have just started on book #9 of the Jim Richards series. I not only highly recommend this first book, CLASSMATE MURDERS, which started it all, but I strongly suggest reading the books in order.  While the books can stand on their own, the charm and appeal of the books (for me, at least) lie in the characters, who feel like friends with whom you don't want to lose touch.

4979,B002DGSKVK,"[1, 1]",5,"First off, I would like to point out that there are a lot of things to love about this book. Although the premise has been visited by other authors in some shape or form previously, I felt this author did a good job of twisting his own tale when he wrote this book. I liked the main character well enough and could understand early in the story where the author was going, without being able to guess the ending. I never felt during reading this book like I was lost or that the book stopped making sense. I did wish to see a little more vibrant descriptions at times, which I thought would have taken the book from ordinary to extraordinary.I found this author had a unique storytelling ability and I was curious enough to see where he was headed with this book, so I managed to finish it up quickly and I was satisfied with the ending. I was impressed that the end of this book didn't feel rushed or too abrupt, as I hate when that happens.What made me decide to leave this book a four star rather than a five, was the errors. There are a lot of them and some of them are truly egregious. These are all things that a good proofreader could have caught before this book was published. The author used the wrong form of a word for example ""The sound of footfalls scrapping across the cavern floor"" or missed a word completely making me go back and read the sentence again and again until it made sense, or used the wrong verb tense. If these issues were fixed, I think with a couple of minor rewrites, this book might deserve a full five stars. As it was, it was a unique and entertaining read that needed a bit of polishing.****Further comments and adjustment of stars****After speaking with this very pleasant author, I have discovered that the version I downloaded a while back has since been edited again, removing the errors that were previously stated in my original review. I would like to now give this book the other star it deserves. I love when an author is concerned enough about the quality of their work that they will actively try to improve it once the book has already been published. Great book worthy of a read.","12 13, 2012",A2VV2MISGXFY1O,"Ionia Martin ""Ionia""",Have now given it five stars,1355356800

The Hall of the Wood definitely can be read without The Five Elements, as it is a satisfying stand-alone book.  The Hall of the Wood incorporates Marlowe's intricate world-building, so necessary for a good fantasy story.  One of the elements of Marlowe's writing that I especially enjoy is his strong female characters.  In Hall of the Wood, these include a knight, a bard/herald, plus a half-dryad.  The story is essentially one of self-discovery by several characters while trying to defeat evil in the forms of a wicked witch and the various types of goblin.  The good guys defeat the goblins, but the goblin lord escapes to menace the future.  Other plot lines are left open, so additional novels in this vein are a possibility.  I read the second edition, so many of the problems noted by other reviewers were resolved.

4981,B002DGSKVK,"[1, 1]",3,"I give this a solid three stars, because while it certainly has serious language issues, I enjoyed the storytelling.What I mean by language issues is that Scott Marlowe, like all too many writers, has a smaller vocabulary than he thinks he does, and tends to use words incorrectly because he doesn't actually know their meaning and they sound like the word he does mean. He doesn't always spell words correctly, either (he consistently writes ""scraping"" as ""scrapping""), and there were examples of ""it's"" for ""its"" and ""who's"" for ""whose"". His sentences sometimes have missing words, change number partway through, are grammatically incomplete or (often) have misrelated participles.All these are issues that a good editor would fix. What's harder to get right is an enjoyable and engaging story, and while Marlowe hardly breaks new ground with this generic secondary-world fantasy, he does tell his story well and avoids the worst cliche of the genre: a Chosen One on a quest to save the world.The issues the characters bring with them made them a little more rounded, and while the plot is occasionally driven by someone doing something stupid, it's always understandably stupid and not (as is so often the case with books like this) unbelievably stupid.With a good editor, and preferably a little more originality in the worldbuilding, this could be a writer to watch.","07 28, 2012",A1IV3OJ6YBL348,Mike Reeves-McMillan,Editing issues but a good story,1343433600

It just seemed as though a few of them were a bit redundant and unnecessary.There is some political intrigue in this novel. However, I enjoyed the fact that the author did not harp on it or go into too much detail. That the author chose to focus on the human aspect of it was a refreshing surprise.While it moved a bit slowly at times, overall, this was a fascinating novel of huge scope. The universe created in the pages of this novel is vast and immensely interesting.The ending is edge-of-your seat action. I love the way the author tied up all of the loose ends. It was a very satisfying conclusion.Character Development: 5 StarsThe characters in this novel are extremely well imagined and written. The powerful young man, Senjal, is depicted as a flawed, emotional, gullible teenager. You love him and wish him well, but at the same time you feel that he needs a good spanking (or some discipline, for the anti-corporal punishment crowd).Kendi, another major character, evokes similar feelings in that he needs to become more mature. For a different twist, he is in love with another man who recently rebuffed him.Writing Style: 4 3/4 StarsThe writing style of this author is terrific. The sentences are well structured with no choppiness. The dialogue is interesting and realistic. He speaks well in the voices of many types of characters from female to male to child.The descriptions are somewhat overdone in unnecessary places. The action, however, is portrayed succinctly, something I especially enjoy.Editing/Formatting: 2 StarsThere were many editing type errors throughout this work. Mostly they were typographical type things, such as missing words. Having a verb missing from a sentence can be a bit distracting. One error that really stood out was a misspelling of the word `kidnapping'. This word appeared quite frequently throughout the novel, but was spelled `kidnaping' every time.The Kindle formatting was also a big issue. At odd moments, a capital letter would replace a space and another letter. The letter `J' was the most common and it replaced 'space a' often.Rating: R for some language, violence, and prostitution references","09 2, 2009",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,Great Start to a Series,1251849600

What she doesn't know is that she is actually the alpha wolf, Taran's, mate. He has been keeping his feelings and his mating instinct a secret because he thinks she will reject him because they are family. When Lark becomes in danger after inadvertently becoming involved in one of Taran's police investigations he must protect her and his own heart.In this world, werewolf's are a known species so there was no big species shocker for Lark which made the storyline flow with ease. I really liked the characters in this story. Taran is still a gruff and bossy alpha wolf but he still has a sense of humor and you can understand why he kept his feelings from Lark. Lark is absolutely hilarious and she loves teasing Taran. She is also not afraid to go after what she wants when she puts her mind to it.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves shifters, romance and some red hot love scenes!

5015,B002DOSBO8,"[0, 0]",4,"4 starsI really enjoyed this story. I liked Lark and Taran and was happy when they worked out their issues and got together. The story was short but it didn't feel as short as I know it was. I didn't feel like anything was missing or it was rushed, the author did a very good job with it. I've read the series before and really enjoyed all 3 books but it's been a while so I felt the need for a reread.Lark is a court reporter and is sweet but also has a bit of a sarcastic mouth at times. She's also in love with her cousin, Taran. Now don't get all freaked...there's no blood relation and they weren't raised together or anything. But he's always been like a big brother to her and he also happens to be a werewolf (which are publicly known in this &#34;world&#34; along with the Fae). Since he's never shown any interest in her as anything more than an annoying little sister/cousin type person, she's gone on with her life and tried to live it but she can't help but long for him. She never expected his true feelings were much different than what he showed her.Taran is an alpha werewolf (but not the Alpha of the local pack, more of a lower ranked alpha within the pack) and a police officer with a shifter task force. He's a good guy and I liked his character. Since Lark grew to maturity, Taran's been attracted to her more than her felt he should be and when he realized she was his destined mate 3 years before, his life went to hell. Taran is convinced that Lark sees him as nothing but an annoying older brother type and wouldn't welcome any advances from him. He's also sure their family would freak even though they're not blood relation so he's kept his feelings secret and suffered with being so close but yet so far from his mate.Lark and Taran get thrown together in a traumatic way when Lark is almost kidnapped by some werewolves that are stealing women to sell in to sexual slavery. Taran saves her but that doesn't end the issue. When she goes home, Taran stakes out her place to watch over her and is barely able to stop another attack on her. He then has to take her home with him to ensure she stays safe. Things go smoothly for a few days, with Tarn mostly avoiding Lark, but eventually things come to a head and they both recognize the attraction between them and engage in a night (and morning) of hot sex. Taran doesn't tell Lark right away that she's his mate though and when she finds out he held that back, she's upset and ends up leaving and staying with a friend until she can think things out. Taran, regardless of the fact he thinks she's rejecting him outright, makes sure she's guarded at her friend's house to prevent any further attacks on her.While things are no going well with Lark, Taran works on making progress on his case trying to get the person responsible for the kidnapping of the women. He makes some progress but not much. He does break down and call Lark (leaving her a great voicemail) which helps the situation greatly and she calls him back (also leaving a voicemail but at least they're talking). Around this time, one of his leads for the case bottoms out in a way that indicates he's got a leak somewhere. He figures out who it most likely is but it also ends up this person is in a position to harm Lark. This leads to some stress and drama but Lark and Taran come through alright in the end (although the main bad guy isn't caught and this case comes back in to the series in book #3). Lark and Taran end the story with some more hot sex and the start to a good HEA.I really liked this story. The characters aren't perfect but they're pretty good and likable. I thought the story was well written, not feeling as short as it actually was. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. I'd recommend this book.

I can't, maybe I should pay attention to those more often? This hot little PNR had everything a paranormal junkee could ask for: Hot sexy werewolf Alpha, tough, but slightly tilted heroine, great writing, interesting back-story, cool shifter dynamics...and the potential to grow. Ms. Holley, no rush or anything, but can I have some more?REVIEW: Incest is best...put your sister to the test. I think that was like some stupid phrase in grammar school or something. Lark and Taran call themselves cousins, but Taran is more like an older brother since Lark actually lived with his mother after her parents died. Technically they are not related at all, but that still doesn't make Lark feel better about her hot fantasies that she has about Taran and the flame that she has been holding for him for like, ever.When Lark gets herself in a bit of trouble with some Euro wolves, a little GHP and an attempt on her life, Taran, who is now a Houston PD detective takes it upon himself to protect Lark. Close quarters and heated emotions might play a little too much for them though, as secrets come out - and hidden feelings are revealed.Can I get a Taran of my own? Yum. This was definitely a fun and entertaining read. I am a fan of both the hero and heroine and all that went along with them. The book kept me glued throughout, not one dip into boredom with this one. Great thing about the kindle on my iPhone - reading in the line picking up the Drama Queen, reading at the football game, reading at the line in the grocery store...reading while I'm doing that web upload at work. Couldn't put it down. My only niggle in the negative about this one was the ending - and I'll try to keep this spoiler free. There was a bit of an unresolved conflict, I wanted to see the outcome of a particular plot thread, which never happened. At least a quick epilogue that tidied everything up. That's it, though, wasn't that big of a deal. The main feature was resolved, so that is all that mattered.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, a lot of happy coupling. PNR fans, werewolf fans should enjoy. While a werewolf book, the paranormal elements are not over-powering, it would be a good contemporary to PNR transition book.","09 18, 2010",A2V98TS4QDDCG9,Parajunkee,A Sexy Story Indeed!,1284768000

The first being that they're ""distant cousins"", but only because the author was too chicken to make them actual siblings. The author made them ""adopted"" siblings anyway so you had the forbidden thing going without becoming icky (even though siblings was clearly what the author wanted to happen anyway!) The second complication was the criminal investigation element. The main male character was a cop and the female main got caught up in a case he was working on. Both of these complications weren't really looked into with great detail. They were just there.***UPDATE: Sorry, my mistake... Kinsey Holly pointed out to me that the main characters aren't cousins, just related by marriage. I also apologize for jumping into conclusions when I said this is what the author intended. I just read too much into it, so forget I said anything about it needing to go into more detail. The only reason I did was because I was looking for more ""mental/emotional turmoil"" plot associated with this particular element, like how to justify the ick factor through love. Different story, different circumstances... Mea culpa. (I'm not being sarcastic, just to be clear.)****The characters themselves had very little personality to speak of, but they didn't need to in order to serve the purpose of this book. The purpose of this book is to have sexy scenes with 2 werewolves. It had that, and they were good scenes. I personally had a good time reading them, but then again I'm quite fond of sexy werewolf stories in general so there's some bias there.3 stars. It was a good werewolf sexy story for werewolf aficionados but probably won't make non-werewolf lovers into were-fans any day soon. Still, they might appreciate the sexy bits anyway since they weren't bad.***UPDATE: Kinsey Holly also pointed out that there are no female werewolves in her universe.

Book 1 of the series. It's a quick read, a simple story, easily forgotten, but you'll enjoy it while you've got it- like cotton candy. Also like cotton candy there will be moments when you want to roll your eyes at how incredibly sweet (or corny) it is. There is no hard, brutal edge to this story.PLOT: There really isn't one and for a day at the beach, that's ok. You're looking for para-romance, then this will cover it. Not really erotica- the sex is simple and straightforward, but HOT all the same.CHARACTERS: Stereotypical- dominant male, sassy, but smaller female protected by big brothers. No development.BOTTOM LINE: This isn't a great book, but it will get you there. If you are looking for something reassuring where the nice guys win, there's hot sex involved and the characters can turn into big angry lions with huge teeth, then this is for you. But don't look for anything other than that.RECOMMENDATIONS: (these are all pretty basic shifter-centric para-romance)1. R.G.

The smallest, the slowest and the oddest looking {in her lion form} she really has no hope to get a man, or to have cubs of her own. On a mission to ""get some"" even if it is from a human in a random pick-up bar, Ava saunters into the local dive and sidles up to the best looking cowboy in the place. Her mission is just about accomplished when she senses her Alpha standing right behind her...""oops.""Resigned to being forced back to the ranch and lorded over by her four over-protective brothers - Ava would never expect that Alpha Landon would actually be hot for her and they would end up hooking up in her driveway. But as she begins to realize that it is probably just because she is in heat her fantasies about hooking the Alpha deteriorate. Well, at least she can have him for one night. That should be enough, right?Short and entertaining, Serengeti Heat was another great bit of PNR to come out of Samhain Publishing. The characters were charming and the setting was interesting. I definitely look forward to reading more from Vivi Andrews. My only negative regarding the book was that it wrapped up too nicely, but this is probably because of the word limit Samhain gives to these anthology novellas. I really expected a bit of back-lash from a few of the not-so-nice characters. ""Meow"" cat fight. Oh well.This is short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here.

It has hot and steamy scenes. It has 2 good looking main characters. And, It's written in an easy manner that doesn't get in the way of the story. Oh, and did I mention the hot and steamy scenes? They were definitely worth the price of the book.Sadly, It suffers from 1 slight problem. The characters felt a tad flat. They were well rounded enough for the purposes of the story but when you actually think about it they don't have much depth to them. Mating is all that seems to matter to them. Not to mention that the male character doesn't go through any growth, character-wise, in the story. But, as I said, because this story doesn't actually need to go to those lengths to make it's point, the characters are good enough.There was actually another thing that I had a problem with, but I'm not sure if it's just my lack of information/knowledge that makes me think it was a mistake. I was always under the impression that lionesses ruled the pride and males were just there for mating purposes. It isn't that they're weaker or anything. It's just that the females do all the actual hunting. At least that was how I thought the social structure of lions worked. I could be wrong...4 stars.

It adds a bit of conflict without carrying on for too long.CONS:- Tall, burly men who play soccer are not entirely unheard of, but the majority of soccer players are average-sized or even smaller-than-average because there's such a call for speed and agility in the sport. The moment I read that our two heroes in this story are the stars of their college soccer team and are 6'4"" and 6'5"", I couldn't help rolling my eyes a bit at the impression of sensationalism I got. Add to that the fact that goalkeepers in soccer are generally referred to as ""keepers"" rather than ""goalies"" (as the story refers to them), and the entire setting lost its believability for me.- As soon as I lost the fight to prevent my eyes from rolling the first time, I was a goner. SO much about this story was silly to me: straight roommates who not only sleep in the same bed, but also cuddle, ""their bodies touching, their arms around each other""? Please. Guys who are so competitive that they'll go as far as kissing each other in a game of ""gay chicken"" just to prove how macho they are? Right.Overall comments: I would certainly pass on reading this ever again. It's not badly written; I just couldn't get past the premise. Every contrived situation the men found themselves in made me curl my lip yet again, and although I liked the protagonists okay, I was annoyed enough by their inability to admit their feelings that I didn't care too much about how things ended up.","06 11, 2012",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T.

Or hold hands. Or make out. We love and care about each other BUT ONLY AS FRIENDS. So let's spend literally an entire novella playing Gay Chicken, because that makes so much sense.This story just made no sense. It was actually embarrassing to read because these two guys acted so disgusted by each other until they were literally having sex. Every other sentence was just denial, denial, denial. ENOUGH ALREADY. This is not a PSA, this is a fluffy erotica novella. We do not want to read some dumb college kid's diatribes about how he looooooves the ladies so he CAN'T POSSIBLY BE GAY.This short, short story was SO trope-heavy, too. So many tropes in one tiny novella. We had Gay for Pay, Gay for You, Only Gay If I Take It Up the Butt, Doing it On a Dare, Camp Gay, Skin the Color of Food Racism, Big Gay Panic, Homophobe Bully, Homophobic Until Proven Gay...The list goes on and on.This story was a waste. It wasn't sexy. It was poorly written, insensitive, offensive, and oftentimes sexist, racist, and homophobic. It is written in a juvenile way with no narrative drive, no creative devices, and very little background info or subplot for either characters.I have so few standards when it comes to romance novels.

I just haven't found the right book, series, or author to drag me (willingly of course ;) into the M/M world. But I think Evangeline just did that for me.Plot wise, Str8te Boys isn't much of a read, but Maverick and Duke were so entertaining I honestly could care less what they did outside that apartment. I'm double daring these hotties to keep rubbing their big, muscular bodies and c***s to one another while making out with lust-filled hunger until they come on each other!Unholy hell... where are my ice buckets?!!!I thought the whole concept for ""gay chicken"" was ridiculous, especially considering that no straight man in his right mind would let another man touch his junk. But here's where thngs get interesting, because Duke and Mav have taken their ""game"" to extreme possibilities. I love that these guys are jocks. They've been playing in the same soccer team for the past four years (plus in my book, I love soccer players ;)), and they've been roomies and bff's since their freshmen year of college. Str8te Boys is told from Maverick's POV, and it's interesting because as ""uncomfortable"" as he gets when Dukes talks guy on guy action, he still allows him to get close. To play with his c*** to kiss, to lick... and so many other sinfully delicious things.Duke is suppose to be straight as well, according to Mav, but it didn't take long for me to begin to question these guys' sexual orientation, and then things really take off when Duke and Mav go to a photo shoot together. Basically a porn site for gay men with straight looking ones.The more Duke and Mav's relationship progresses, the more Mav begins to question his nature. Everything seems perfect for the two until a late night trip to the drugstore ends with Duke's heart being broken. Now, Mav must come to terms with who he truly is, or risk losing not only his best friend, but his heart as well.Like I said, the idea of ""Gay Chicken"" for me was ridiculous, but so very clever at the same time. Both Mav and Duke were great characters. I would have loved seeing some soccer action, and them interacting outside of each other. But the scenes were so delicious between these two I'll happily shut up as long as I get front row seats and touch action! *Rawr* ;) I'll be sticking to Evangeline Anderson for more sinfulness from now on.","05 4, 2013",A2JB33XTGRG2PA,"Love, Lust, Books",Loved it!!,1367625600

I think it can be beatifully and sensibly done too, just not in this book in my opinion. I was ready to scream more than once when I was reading it indeed and not just about who pitches and who catches. I was ready to scream when author made her characters say over and over AND OVER again how they do not want to do REALLY gay stuff, whatever that meant for them in any given moment. Or when one of the characters when they are getting ready to pose for the calendar and watch gay couple posing says that he is relieved that heavy duty gay action was over.Guess what you dolts? No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual. If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on, just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let's not forget the ""he has gay friends"" thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique, contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on. Yes, sex is hot, no book in my view is still horrible.And those are smart boys, yes? Studying to be pharmacist and another one is supposed to go to prestigious Ivy League business school?

The physical attraction that develops is based on that friendship, and even though it blindsides one more than the other, it feels believable.  The story is obviously about discovering or uncovering things about your sexuality that you hadn't realized were there, and then trusting your heart as you fight for your HEA.Using the game of gay chicken as a guise for exploring their sexuality, Duke and Mav steamed up the pages on their way to falling in love.

They are best friends and throughout the four years they've lived together they've become really close.  Except now they are about to get a whole lot closer.This story is told only from Mav's point of view and he's dealing with being attracted to Duke.  Duke doesn't make things easier as he is always being very close and physical and then there's the games of gay chicken...and extremely gay chicken.  When they are coming up short to pay their last month of rent they end up posing for some se xy pictures for the Str8te Boys website.

There's some explicit sex, and Ryan and Dan the standard sensitive bottom and alpha male protector, respectively.  So, why are there so many positive reviews?  Sometimes a reader just wants a simple ""happily ever after"" and this satisfies on that level.  No, it's not Shakespeare, or even a particularly original romance.  But, it is not the worst gay romance I have read and it didn't set me up for a great story and fail to deliver.  My expectations were low.  I wanted something with some sex and an HEA to while away the time while waiting for my plane.  I don't regret reading it, but it wasn't memorable either.

City of Rogues made me pause, though. This novel has the foundation to be good book, but is lacking in important areas.The best part of City of Rogues is the pace and action. There is constant action, and the plot moves forward at a good pace, certainly not too slow, but also not too fast. The plot helps the pacing, but is pretty straightforward. The language is clear and makes for an easy read. The action scenes are written quite well. The level of worldbuilding is satisfying, even original in places, and hints at some interesting matters which may become relevant later in the trilogy.I was mainly disappointed by the characters. Ty Johnston created some promising characters, notably Kron, Belgad , Gris, Markwood and Randall, and to a certain extent also Lucius, Adara, Wyck and Stilp. But the promise never develops into something more, as the characters stay two-dimensional, and at several junctions in the story make some head-scratching decisions based on weak explanations. Also, I never had the feeling that I really got into the characters skin, and had trouble to identify with them and care for them. The fact that the POV would jump from character to character, often in mid-scene, didn't help at all. On the flip side, Johnston at least did paint most of the characters grey, with the villains showing some positive traits, and the heroes some bad ones. It just wasn't developed enough, much to my regret.Overall, this book shows some promise, and I may end up buying the next book. But City of Rogues could have been so much better, and it is a pity that it isn't.","05 1, 2011",A37A0JHJC5UXG6,Dave,Not quite there yet,1304208000

She has an eager audience on the East Coast. A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is her third Kate Lawrence mystery, and she has published three non-fiction books.Kate Lawrence is undergoing several lifestyle changes at once: her long-time love, Armando, is moving in with her; her daughter is stretching her wings and has a new boyfriend; and her son is incommunicado with new exploits. To add to this, a telephone call from a couple of elderly spinsters who live in a grand old historic mansion reveals an actual skeleton in a closet that has been bricked up for forty some years. Kate is in the real estate business with a couple of lively women partners, and they rush over to be of assistance to the confused little old ladies. But by the time Kate rushes to their aid, the body has disappeared:""A pile of old bricks, mortar, splintered wood and other debris attested to the recent demolition of a narrow section of wall at the back of a closet next to a huge, ancient furnace. The new opening revealed a narrow space. John's flashlight shone on the pipes leading to the ancient boiler, one of which was leaking visibly. On the floor at the rear of the closet next to the pipes lay something that looked like a rag along with more bits of mortar and brick. I thought the cloth was dark blue, but I couldn't be certain. Except for some shelving filled with books and files along the back wall of the closet-like space, it was empty. I blinked and looked again. No body, no bones, nothing.""A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is a delightful cozy mystery, New England style. One can almost imagine Kate Lawrence as a younger version of Jessica Fletcher. Her fiery romance with the elegant Armando contributes romance, and her friends and fellow realtors provide glamour and humor. Kate is undergoing a midlife crisis of sorts, which actually grounds her and provides the reader with a glimpse of a middle-aged adventurer.

Kate snaps photos of the swans - two parent swans with their four little cygnets - to document their progress.Kate is co-owner of MACK Realty and Emma, a paralegal, is launching a real estate law practice with a friend. The morning walk mixes business with pleasure. Mother and daughter admire properties as they hike ""the loop"" where ""nearly every Cape Cod, Colonial, Victorian and farmhouse along our route shone with fresh paint and liberally applied elbow grease.""So what can go wrong on such a glorious summer morning? The answer waits in Kate's office. Someone has sent her the stinking bud of a corpse flower and a clipping about the plant's anticipated flowering at the end of June. The anonymous gift is wrapped in a sheet of paper with scribbling in the margin: ""It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you. And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink.""The poison pen letter is almost ignored in the confusion that results when a plumber finds a skeleton hidden in an historic house belonging to ""the Henstock girls."" The ""girls"" are the spinster sisters Ada and Lavinia, now in their eighties.By the time the cops arrive, the skeleton has disappeared. It promptly turns up in photos Kate took of the swans swimming serenely in the pond, and the anonymous letter writer strikes again. There's another clipping about the stinky corpse flower and this time the scribbling reads: ""The lovesick, the betrayed, and the jealous all smell alike.""So much for a ho-hum life in the quaint little town of Wethersfield.The poison pen letters seem directed to Kate, who is on the verge of cohabitation with Armando, an attractive South American transplant who is the controller of a telecommunications company. However, the letters could as easily be directed to her two partners: Margo, a southern belle who is in a relationship with a cop named John, and ""Strutter,"" a Jamaican immigrant, whose husband is also named John.Kate is a magnet for trouble. She's tailed by someone driving a black van. The man knocks on her door late at night. Does she call the cops? No, she calls one of her partners and the cops come swarming in. Meanwhile, the plumber who discovered the skeleton in the Henstock house is nowhere to be found - fake ID, non-working cell phone number.And what about those pesky letters? When Kate is mugged in a parking lot, the investigation kicks into high gear.Kate is an amateur sleuth in the tradition of Miss Marple and Jessica Fletcher, attuned to the people in her small town, pooh-poohing any perceived danger to herself, quick to give others the benefit of a doubt.Some minor nitpicks: In one place, Kate's relationship with Armando lasted 8 years; in another it's 7 years; and in yet another she has known him for 5 years. Also, Margo's speech is full of dropped ""g's"" when a couple of instances would have sufficed.This was a comfort read that I hated to see end. Like Kate, I was caught up in the goings-on in Wethersfield, curious about the skeleton and the fate of the two old sisters and wondering how Kate would adjust to Armando's moving in with her.","02 2, 2012",A3AVIHQYF0SADC,"Pat Browning ""Mystery author""",A poison pen letter and disappearing skeleton,1328140800

There were unnecessary details (such as the main character thinking of throwing his clothes over the rail and then deciding not to as he would have to bend over to pick them up downstairs). And there was the way the main character was laid up for over a day by simply falling down and hitting his head. Elsewhere, the main character is described as having a ""muscled stomach"", yet he is easily injured in his encounter with the heroine's father.The mystery of what happened in the house is quite intriguing. But there is no good explanation offered for why the main character keeps falling back in time.I have to tell you, my favorite parts of this book were the more incidental scenes of small town life. When the plot moves in, it is flawed and unbelievable. I gave up over 60% of the way through the book, having had the plausibility stretched to the breaking point.This book needs to be edited for content, which is a shame because it holds such promise.

Now I enjoy reading them.  Some are a little too repetitive in that he reuses certain material.  At least one had virtually no ending.  Some are too predictable.  All are well written and pleasant to read, just a little dated.  I would have to say overall that I enjoy the stories in the book and would recommend it if you are tired of some of the more modern trends in writing.  With Lovecraft you have to have an imagination.  He counts on it and plays with it in order to achieve his goal of giving you the creeps.  He takes you just so far and then lets your mind do the rest.  This requires a certain talent both from the writer and the reader.

His Mythos is complicated and engaging.Lovecraft does a good job of referencing some earlier stories.  It's nice to hear about the Innsmouth Curse, for example, in multiple stories.  Though, you might get sick of hearing of the Mad Arab who wrote the Necronomican.  Seriously, was Mad part of his name?This collection, in my opinion, is front-loaded with the best stuff.  My favorites being The Call of Cthulhu, The Dunwich Horror and The Shadow over Innsmouth.  Though, the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath is really good also.Now, be warned, this was written in a time when different language was acceptable.

5139,B002E19KU4,"[1, 1]",4,"I can understand why more readers haven't discovered H.P. Lovecraft. Many of today's readers prefer the sudden shock of horror featured in modern horror stories and films to Lovecraft's slowly building sense of unease. Lovecraft is the foul breath across the back of the neck or the cold hand that brushes your's in the dark. In other words, it takes a bit of work to appreciate Lovecraft's stories. Written mostly in the 1920s and '30s, Lovecraft may seem a bit outdated, but getting to know his tales is worth the effort.In this volume are 67 of Lovecraft's stories. I would argue that this collection is not necessarily ""definitive,"" but at least it provides a good overview of his work. Here are many stories in his Cthulhu mythos. For the uninitiated, these are stories of ancient gods who are at best indifferent to mankind's existence (and at worst outright hostile). There are also stories that stand alone and are creepy in their own right without the presence of ancient god-like beings. Many of his stories were originally published in the early pulp magazines, but don't let that questionable pedigree scare you away.Among my favorites are At the Mountain of Madness, The Colour Out of Space, Cool Air and ... well, just read them for yourself and pick your own favorites. A couple of minor caveats, however. First, Lovecraft depends more on mood and creepiness to tell his stories. For readers accustomed to horror that is both quick and gross, Lovecraft may seem curiously old-fashioned. Two, Lovecraft was a product of his times. As such, some of his depictions may come across as racist. Beyond that, enjoy these stories - whether you are reading them for the first time or coming back to them after years away. This collection marks an excellent point at which to start.","10 31, 2011",A38Q3T99Z5X2LX,W. V. Buckley,The literary equivalent of a cold draft across the back of your neck,1320019200

Robyn was a little too accepting of learning that not only are werewolves real, but that she's a werewolf too! And oh yeah, hunky stranger is destined to be her mate so it's okay to sleep together immediately. Sure she was surprised at first by the werewolf thing, then it was all no big deal. Um, really? I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure I would need a little more time to process all that new information!I had a few other problems with the story, aside from Robyn's easy acceptance. The issue of her being deaf wasn't really addressed. Apparently she's a champion lip-reader and surprise! As mates, Robyn and Keil had no problem communicating. Really? Wouldn't being deaf be more of an obstacle? It was almost a non-issue, like the color of her hair or what she did for a living. I was sort of looking forward to it being a more interesting aspect of the story. And while Robyn started out as a strong, self-sufficient woman, that part of her seemed to disappear once she found her man.Aside from being a short read (less than 100 pages), I found myself skimming the sex scenes. The author used a few words that I just don't like and don't think belong in writing. I might be a prude, but I don't like sex scenes using offensive (to me) language. And does anyone really talk like that during sex? Outside of bad movies, I don't think so! Really ruined that part of the story for me.Gave this one a 2/5 as I liked the premise and thought it was an original idea, but it was too short, problems were too easily solved, and it had some offensive (to me) language.

I didn't get much out of it, to be honest. I got into it, was enjoying myself very much reading, and then the main characters met (a ""helpless"" woman meeting two huge strangers in the middle of nowhere at night) and they got cuddly that very first night. Really? And the very next morning, they reveal that not only are they werewolves, she is one too! And she thinks it's really cool. Okay, fine, I can admit that if someone told me I was a werewolf, I'd be ecstatic.But then they can't have sex. Then they HAVE to have sex. Then they're in mortal danger, and in a blink all of a sudden the helpless deaf former-human is ordering around a pack hell bent on tearing them apart. What? And all this in how many words? This could have been stretched out and developed into an amazing full-length novel. It just seems all too neat in the end. Everything that was such a huge obstacle just magically turned out to be nothing but a speed bump and the heroine just wakes up one day, her world turned upside down and she's all peachy, going along with the program like it's the most natural thing.

OR to have to explain to her that she is a wolf in the first place. Language barriers aside these two have some smoking hot chemistry and sex!! HOLY SMOKES!!I loved this book. It was one of those where it makes you wish you would meet this smoking hot man, with abs for days, and have him tell you that you are his mate. Sign me up for some of that!! This book has some great funny banter between everyone. I really loved the sibling like interactions between Robyn and TJ, and then once the wolf telepathy starts between Robyn and Keil that amps up the hotness level for me. This is really a great book!

She is arguing with her brother letting him know that she can go on a trip all by herself. I already liked her. Then, the story takes a shift in to fast, skippy, and lacking luster. The plot goes sour when she runs into two wolves who tell her she's one. She willingy accepts it, accepts that she's the mate of one, and then they have lots of sex where she goes places she's never been willingly. This once fiesty, independent girl became a willing dependent in a matter of a page turn. It was written ok, but the plot went out the window once she got to the cabin. Beyond that, it goes boring and then ends with a girl who on her first night is going to have sex in wolf form in front of the whole pack with her new mate she's known all of a week. I'd say that the girl lost her mind in the woods mostly. Hopefully the writer will get more inventive and risk lengthening the story in order to give more depth to the plot.","04 1, 2010",AN8ELR6AHMMQ,"Jessss ""I read to find stories that inspire m...","Ok, but not great",1270080000

Seemingly, the book had a single path the story followed without many twists and turns. I'd have also liked to see more action. The showdown didn't happened until close to the end. By then, I was in a hurry to move on to another book.WOLF SIGNS is the first book of the Granite Lake Wolves series. Even though this book was a quick read, I won't be continuing on with the series.

5169,B002E7ARKK,"[1, 1]",4,"I couldn't remember if I had ever read anything by Vivian Arend so got ""Wolf Signs"" when it was a freebie back in April (bypassed the Kindle version and downloaded a different format). I tend to avoid novelettes but after being disappointed by another book, this story was the perfect escapist feel-good pick-me-up--enjoyable so long as one keeps in mind the following: ""destined mate/instant love"" means near-instant sex; at less than 100 pages, the plot points have to arise and be resolved at hyper-speed; and the story is not intended to be a heavy, serious paranormal/urban fantasy. It is definitely ""erotica"" but considering that it's a Samhain product, I found the sex scene pretty tame and almost secondary to the overall story.The story is well-written and includes a fairly well-developed storyline for its short length (with enough tidbits for future books in this series). The characters, for the most part, are likable and memorable in that each deviated in some way from shifter/were stereotypes. I especially loved the walking disaster (in human form) that was TJ, the brother. In contrast, I tried to like Robyn more but for some reason, I found her annoying at times, and I just couldn't get over the deaf-person-going-backcountry-alone-is-not-TSTL hurdle. (Oh yeah, and that deaf person is a lone female staying at a communal cabin.)On the flip side, the alpha challenge? BOO! HISS! OK, maybe I'm a little bloodthirsty but it was described as ""to the death"" (*gasp*) and it turned out to be...not. Given how it occurred, the end result jumped the rails in favor of the story's funnier side. I also wouldn't have minded something at the end to address, however briefly, how much Robyn's adoptive parents knew about her wolf heritage (since her adoptive brother did).","09 9, 2012",A6JFZZYFUV8B3,KarmaBites,"Quick, light-hearted read (but had potential for lot more)",1347148800

However, as a deaf woman talking to people around her,  communication becomes draining and leaves her needing solitude to recharge. Her brother Tad may have had to cancel on their ski trip at the last minute, but Robin decides to go by herself, looking forward to peace and quiet. When Robin is interrupted on her trip by the appealing Keil and his brother, she discovers life will never be the same again.Wolf Signs is a short, fast read that will appeal to paranormal romance and erotica lovers alike. Robin is stunned to find out that werewolves real, she never really knew the truth about her family, and that she has found her very own wolf mate in Keil. The attraction is immediate and hot enough to melt the mountain snow. Personally, I am not a big fan of erotica so I admit, I skipped the sex scenes, but the bits I saw are sure to satisfy readers who enjoy erotica.The plot was kept somewhat simplified to fit into the shorter word count, but Vivian Arend still managed to pack in a lot of action to keep the story moving. I loved how Robin was so happy to find out why she never quite felt like she fit anywhere, and adjusts quite easily to her new life. We even get a little bit of suspense over worrying about what will happen when Keil returns to his pack for the alpha challenge.All in all, Wolf Signs is a short, sexy, and satisfying read. Kelley A.

I really liked Robyn because she wasn't afraid to speak her mind even though she's deaf she was definetly a strong female lead in the beginning but as the book progressed I hated the fact that she began to defer to Keil more and more, yet with others she'd be more of an alpha herself. I thought that part was a bit ridiculous but that's just me.I found that the basic plot of the book was pretty good given that the book is less than 100 pages long. I liked it but as some readers may know I'm not overtly fond really short books or e-books. I like my books to be longer, my other issue with the book was that while I knew it might be a little steamy with the sex stuff I thought it was really awkward and forced as if the writer was uncomfortable writing about the sex scenes and that bugged me.However, the book was pretty funny. There were plenty of parts where I had t chuckle because the author actually seems to have a pretty good sense of humour, but I wish she used it more. In the end though I actually thought this was a pretty good book. I've read better and I've certainly read worse. I wish the book dealt more with the shifting side and less of the sex side but I know I'll have to read the rest of the series like I'm planning to.It's worth the read, it killed some time and it was better than I thought it would be.

5177,B002E7ARKK,"[0, 0]",2,"I was drawn to this novel by the rather ""daring"" factor that the author had chosen a disabled protagonist - in this case, a deaf girl. Aside from that, it was a pretty disappointing read, going swiftly downhill. The relationships between Robyn and the wolf brothers was too sudden, especially her attraction to Kail - there was no doubt in her mind, not even any sort of inner cautionary voice - no, the moment she saw him she literally turned into an uninhibited sex fiend. As for his poor brother... TJ's sole presence in the book was to be made a mockery of and treated as if he were some sort of clowning duffus to be gotten ridden of as soon as things got a little hot and heavy between the two protagonists. And even then - when her brother finds out the truth - it turns out he knew all along! And don't get me started on the sex scenes! Actually, do get me started. They were NOT SEXY. Do we really need descriptions of body parts? And oh, he's so well hung - well what a surprise - aren't all male protagonists? And I hate, hate, hate the word ""milked"". Please. No. Not when you're discussing sex. It's just... gross.This novel read like a pale shadow of a Nalini Singh book. The concepts were almost the same, the sexual tension similar (although Arend did not draw that out nearly enough for it to be particularly steamy). But, of course, with one major difference. Singh is a good author.And sexual tension not withstanding - there was no actual action tension either. The characters hardly seemed to be at risk for their life, and I think this was just someone's wolf fantasy.Oh, and what happened to the big fight? The actual ritualistic fight for alpha wolf. It just never happened - the story just finished! 13% from the end of the ebook, I was quite surprised.Arend, perhaps your work gets better as you go along.

The description sounded like an interesting take on a tried and true storyline of girl wolf meets wolf mate--has a few issues, threatened with death, but lives happily ever after.  The different take was that she was mute.  Except she's not mute.  She can speak a bit--ok, there are mute people who are able to articulate somewhat, but our girl can speak with an Alpha voice and force grown, mean, desperate wolves to lay down and show their belly to her.  Yeah, right.Other than a short plot about figuring out she was a wolf--and that took her only a few pages to accept--and a short threatening scene which she handled with that Alpha voice, the rest of the book was about sex.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that was the entire reason the publishing company chose to publish it--as a soft-porn venture with a little, very little, plot thrown in.  The company is Samhain.  They do have an amusing website.  Apparently you can get anything in romance that you desire.  They list categories of romance comedy, contemporary, fantasy, gay-lesbian, historical, horror (I can't imagine a horror romance.),inspirational ????, interracial, suspense, time travel, and western. Everything that is except a well-written book? I plan on checking publishing company names and avoiding anything from them in the future.","02 26, 2010",A17J0MBCTL5J11,P. Fox,A short story,1267142400

In the scene where Robyn first encounters him and his brother Keil, it was from his point of view, so I automatically latched onto him.

5198,B002EAYQ9A,"[0, 0]",4,"A competent thriller that succeeds on most levels. It's economically written, authoritative about newspaper newsrooms and statehouse journalism, and its characters are skillfully drawn (if slightly cliched; does every newsroom in fiction have an alcoholic burnout of a onetime star reporter on his last chance?).The clockspring tension and suspense is well-developed, though the moralizing about the rapacious nature of news reportage goes a bit over the top. The reveal of the killer, which offers a clever twist on real Harrisburg history (look up R. Budd Dwyer for a look at the true horror story than inspired ""Kill The Story""), leads to a delicious doozy of a climactic scene.My only real complaint, as another reviewer here aptly pointed out, is that there is no way the reader could have guessed the identity of the killer before the big reveal. That made the reveal less of a powerhouse moment then it could have and should have been, and made the ponderous exercise of piecing together the connection between the murder victims to that point into an elaborate jerk-around at the readers' expense.Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the text contained more typos and other careless errors than should ever have come from a self-respecting journalist (which the author obviously was at one time). It just goes to show that every writer needs a strong copy editor.All in all, however, ""Kill The Story"" is a reasonably well-crafted thriller that largely delivers on its intriguing premise.

She was supposed to be in Afghanistan to counsel soldiers; but, instead she was standing before a very handsome stranger who introduced himself as Shahryar with the request for her to tell him a story each night for the next one thousand and one nights.  What came as an even more of a shocker to Rolanda was that he knew her erotic romance writing pen name.Biding her time while planning her escape, Rolanda composed her first night's fiction entitled Positively Despotic...In the land of Frumos - where two brothers were bounded by magic, by birth and the love of one woman - as long as the triad was whole, the land would be peaceful and prosperous; however if it was to be broken only destruction and hostility would exist.  For a century, that bond had been broken by treachery and black magic - now the time had come for the current ruling brothers to find and unite with their special woman to restore tranquility and harmony throughout land of Frumos.The Alexandrescu's brothers Valentin and Dragos were perceived by the outside world to brutally take whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted.  Well, international reporter Kiana Davis was determined to discover if all the negative rumors surrounding the Alexandrescu brothers were true.  Kiana gained more than she bargained for when she discovered nothing was quite as it seemed.  What came as even more of a surprise was her strong attraction to both Valentin and Dragos and the brothers' insistence that she was the one to complete their triad.Author Shara Azod has managed to roll two fantastic stories into one with Positively Despotic.  The first couple, Rolanda and Shahryar, will remain a secondary focal point for the entire series of 1,001 Nights with Shara.  I was greatly intrigued by this couple.  Ms. Azod successful carved Shahryar into a great, sexy mystery that I am eager to discover more about.  Rolanda will definitely have to stay on her toes with him because I have a feeling that very soon she will be the star in Shahryar's bedroom scene long before her 1,001 nights' freedom come knocking at the door.However, the main plot revolved around a threesome couple.  Instant sparks flew and the flames burning hotly until the very end.  Even though the storyline took place over a couple of days, Ms. Azod still managed to craft a plausible, spell-bounding tale with incredible characters.  Valentin and Dragos were dominate, sexy and very charming alphas, while Kiana proved to be a strong, intelligent heroine.  Their sexcapades, whether as a twosome or threesome, were passionately erotic and frequent in nature.  All in all, Positively Despotic was fabulous read that I am sure many will enjoy.NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","04 8, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1001 Steamy Nights,1270684800

The way the world is set up made me think very much of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell...just not on as grand of a scale.The characters were written well. I never had to stop to figure out why a certain character acted a certain way - everybody was developed enough, and had clear enough personalities, despite not being mentioned for more than a paragraph or two. Even the side characters had clear motivations. It was nice to read a book where everything was put in place for a reason, and all plots get tied up.The only problem I had with this book was the whole Miranda not figuring out what happened bit. For as smart as she was, she really should have caught on sooner...or if not caught on, she should have at least started questioning things. Every time something new got pointed out, I just wanted to scream when she didn't think twice about her observations.

Have you ever joked about how in books and movies you never see people eating or going to the bathroom? This book is a testament to why that is. It is not interesting to read about. The story has a lot of potential--a suspicious disappearance, a mysterious cat, shady politicians, a police cover-up--and despite all this the protagonist spends most of the time getting her train ticket punched. The author makes a big deal about the strange cat who follows her around, but once they get underway it literally does nothing but poop in the hotel room. The title should be ""Miranda Eats a Meat Pie for Dinner"" because that's all she really accomplishes (Seriously, someone should count up all the time they mention meat pies because it's a lot. I would do it but I think my eyes would melt if I read one more boring word of this book). It's really painfully obvious from the beginning what happened to the husband, and who is the bad guy, and the ""truth"" about magic. I am mostly annoyed that the author took the time to create this whole interesting, complex universe and then didn't do anything with it. The parts about the magicians are waaaay more interesting than Miranda reading a newspaper. Which she does. A lot. I only finished it to find out what happens, and that was disappointing too.

I put ""story"" in quotes because, although it's that way in the title, this is actually a novel.The plot was original with a gritty, noir setting. The fantasy world of Markhat was enthralling. Mr. Tuttle really knows how to draw the reader into a different world by showing the way things are, instead of just telling about it.The storyline moved at a fairly fast pace. There were some twists and turns that left me gasping, once even bringing a few tears. Although the book is filled with Vampires and other odd creatures, it is still a very `human' story.Although this book is part of a series featuring the character of Markhat, like the others, it can be read as a stand-alone.Character Development: 5 StarsMarkhat was a wonderfully deep character with an interesting past that was revealed in bits and pieces throughout the story. He was always `in character' with believable motivations.Mama Hog was also present in this installment. I was happy to see her again as she is the perfect companion and mother-figure for Markhat.The new characters introduced in this book were also very well-drawn. Each had their own motives and personalities, making them likable or easy to hate, as needed.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle was in his usual fine form. There was humor interlaced through even the most gruesome portions. The humor was sometimes blatant and, at other times, a bit obscure, but always there if a reader cared to look, and I did.The descriptions were vivid. The dialogue was snappy and in good form.

Hold the Dark is definitely the longest and most enjoyable of the three Markhat stories.  I added the ""sort of"" qualifier in the review title because it ticks me off when publishers (I assume they make this decision) add excerpts from other works at the end of a Kindle edition.  Since Kindle edition works have no page numbers, readers use a percentage display to gauge how much of a work they've read.  Hold the Dark ends at 89% of the Kindle document and the last 11% is excerpts from the other two Markhat works, which is ridiculous because they are really just short stories, and from a work by some other author presumably from the same publisher.I realize that printed novels have also started appending excerpts but with a printed work you can find out easily see that excerpts are there and determine on what page the book will actually end. This is not so easy to do when reading a Kindle edition which for me meant an unpleasant surprise when the book prematurely ended with me wanting more Markhat.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Frank Tuttle's writing and the especially the Markhat character and would buy another one sight unseen.  Several new and possibly recurring characters are developed in Hold the Dark which hopefully will find their way into future Markhat works.  I won't add spoilers about the plot but will suffice to say it is a page-turner.  I suppose Hold the Dark stands alone but readers would probably find it more satisfying if they read the two previous Markhat short stories first.Frank, if you're reading this, and I suspect you are given that you reviewed one of your other Markhat books yourself, please get your publisher to cease and desist or at least put a disclaimer at the beginning of future works warning Kindle readers that excerpts are at the end.

It tells the story of what happened to Kaylee during the week she spent in the psychiatric unit referenced in My Soul to Take.Nash makes a brief appearance early on, but that's it. And there aren't any other romantic interests for Kaylee in MY SOUL TO LOSE either. Most of this short story revolves around her enduring the many indignities of being committed. There is also a mystery introduced with the character and fellow patient Lydia that I'm hoping will be further explained in future books.As an audiobook, and I'm a huge audiobook fan--they're an insomniac's best friend--MY SOUL TO LOSE is pretty good. The narrator is not great, but not distractingly bad a la the narrator for the Twilight Saga. You can listen to a sample before downloading if you're worried. The story is short, only 1 hour and 48 mins.

I easily sympathized with her and I easily loved Emma for being a very supportive friend. I am curious with one character in this book though--Lydia. She's mysterious and yet she seems to know Kaylee's secret and she's the only person in the institute who can understand her. I'm curious about what happened to her after she helped Kaylee and it would be great to know more about her in the next books.

First of all,if you are like me, probably you will need to listen to it twice. The first time the initial ten minutes were confusing and I couldn't follow the story.  Kept listening and began to like it, especially when she is at the hospital and interacting with Lydia.  I decided on listening again and now this series is on my radar. The premise of Soul Screamers is interesting.  Kaylee gets this uncontrollable desire to scream.  Everybody thinks she gets panic attacks but it is something more. Her situation has a supernatural motivation that I find curious and I want to know more of this character.About the characters:I find Lydia a potentially great character. She is intriguing. She has an ability that could help Kaylee but I can't help but ask myself at what price to her own safety.  At the other side of the spectrum I see Kaylee's aunt.  She doesn't sound like someone Kaylee grew up with.  I don't feel to much empathy toward her.About the narration:It took me a little time to get used to Amanda Ronconi's style.  At the book's beginning she sounded detached, almost informative.  Her voice sounded in third person although she used pronouns ""me"" and ""I"" in her narration.  As the audio progressed she definitively was Kaylee.  As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I listened to this audio twice.  The second time in my listening, Ronconi sounds detached at the same parts as well.I give a 4 to the story and a 3 to the narration.

While I think it probably isn't absolutely necessary to read this novella before the rest of the series, I found it to be a lovely introduction to the world and characters. It left me with a huge urge to read the first book which hopefully I'll get to do really soon! Sometimes novellas can be lacking in substance or feel like they were cut short but this one certainly wasn't.The story starts off with a bang. Kaylee Cavanaugh is trying to enjoy a day out with a friend but her 'panic attacks' are getting in the way of that. Kaylee's really having a tough time of it. She screams for no apparent reason and there's nothing she can do about it! Fearing she is mentally ill, she is admitted to a psychiatric unit and even had to be sedated for 15 hours. This story mostly takes place inside the unit. I've read a fair few books that feature psychiatric hospitals and I think of all of them, this one was the easiest to picture.Rachel Vincent's writing is just amazing! I could see everything clearly in my head and there was so much emotion throughout the story it was almost tangible. When Kaylee was having one of her attacks, it was described so well you could almost feel it yourself. You could sense her panic, fear and confusion. It really gets inside your head and makes you realize what Kaylee is going through. I just loved how real it all felt even if the circumstances and reasons behind it were a little surreal!This is definitely one to read in a single sitting. I was so captivated by the story, I couldn't tear my eyes away from Kindle. I loved the ideas, the mystery and the characters. Kaylee is a likable person and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better in the next book. If you want to test this series out, this novella is really a good way to do so!

In this story both readers and Kaylee are unaware of just what is wrong with her and why she has debilitating ""panic attacks"" that cause her to scream uncontrollably, to see things that shouldn't be there, and that leave her hoarse, terrified and questioning her sanity.And while the novella creates more questions than provides answers, it does introduce readers to Kaylee and gives them a look at a heroine who is in many ways a normal, frightened teenage girl who just wishes none of this was happening to her, but who is also strong and selfless and who manages to retain her sarcasm and sense of humor through it all.My Soul to Lose is an exciting and immensely entertaining introduction to this series. It develops the main character and teases the world enough for readers to want to know more. It gives readers a feel for the author's writing style and gives them a peek at several characters who will make an appearance in later books in the series.Whether the novella is read prior to having read any or all of the full-length books in the series or not, it will be captivating and intriguing, humorous and heartbreaking, a little bit shocking and most definitely eye-opening.While My Soul to Lose can be read at any point during the series, reading it prior to the first book offers a very different experience for readers than reading it at any point thereafter. But for new readers and fans of the series alike, this novella is an absolute must read.","06 14, 2012",A1ZHEK7NJJWKE9,Fiktshun,An immensely entertaining introduction to this series,1339632000

Without warning Kaylee begins to tremble and sweat as panic and fear assault her senses. Deep inside she can feel the scream beginning to swell, building and pushing to break free to pierce the air. Desperate, Kaylee gasps for Emma to help her. Quickly, the two girls dash down the corridor and take refuge among the brightly colored, towering stacks of bath towels in a department store. Scared and shaking Kaylee slowly gains control, until the frail, boy in the wheel chair turns the corner. This time she cannot stop the impulse and her shockingly, loud scream reverberates through the air. A wave of tremendous sadness washes over her and tears stream down her cheeks. She falls to her knees unable to cease the deafening wail emanating from her lungs. Clawing at her throat and gasping for air until the fog appears and she falls into blackness. Frightening images flee through her mind and then she wakes to a nightmarish reality. Kaylee is restrained to a bed in a cold, windowless room. Her limbs ache and her voice is raw. Where is she? Kaylee discovers that fifteen hours flew by while she lay shackled and unconscious in the mental institution. Is she crazy? Kaylee navigates around the dire, confines of her new surroundings. Her typical, teenage wardrobe is now sparkly, sweat suits minus the drawstrings ( to prevent hangings) and soft, fuzzy socks. Time is spent, avoiding group therapy sessions and completing crossword and jigsaw puzzles, while her mind plots a way out. A strange girl with mesmerizing green eyes watches her every move. At last Kaylee is on the brink of gaining her freedom when terror rips through her. Again the howling festers and swirls in her throat, threatening to explode out of her, no matter how hard she clamps her jaw. Lydia, the green eyed girl grabs her hand and tugs her down the hall. Inexplicably, Lydia manages to halt the ear splitting howl but at what price? Why is Kaylee unable to control the intense and powerful screams?Rachel Vincent manages to yank you into Kaylee's world with her powerful, short prequel. I was riveted to the story. It is intense to say the least. I swear my jaw ached in sympathy as Kaylee tries to clench back her painful, ear splitting screams (I wonder how her screams compare to those of my three year old daughter on a bad day).

During a trip to the mall with her best friend, Emma, she finds herself having what she calls a ""panic attack"".  She has always had these but has never had a full explanation of their cause.  The moment she sees a boy in a wheelchair she feels one of her ""panic attacks"" coming on.  The difference between this panic attack is that this she not only screams uncontrollably but it also lands her in the Mental Ward.  After screaming her lungs out to the point of exhaustion she wakes up strapped to a bed, unable to move, in a small white room.  During her forced ""sentence"" in the Mental Ward she meets a very interesting fellow patient, who herself has a special ability (but no spoilers!).Rachel Vincent's prequel is a wonderful glance and explanation into Kaylee's personal experience with her pre-bean sidhe knowledge.  In the following novels, thoughts of her time in th Mental Ward are brought to the surface more than once.  She constantly struggles with the affect of her bean sidhe gift and how for the longest time she thought she might have actually been crazy.  This in turn has affected her, in more ways than one.  My Sou to Loose also helps answer many questions that come up in the following novels (again no spoilers!). It also shows how strong Kaylee is - not many girls go to the Mental Ward, then learn that they help souls by screaming their lungs out, live for hundreds of years, all in a few months time and then have the mental capability and maturity to accept it and embrace it.As always, Rachel Vincent's ability to write in perfect detail astounds me.  In My Soul To Loose Kaylee visits the Netherworld for the first time, even though she has no idea what it is, let alone has a name for it.  Rachel Vincent's descriptions of this world sends chills up your spine.  Unlike in the following novels, she is very careful to not give away too much of this world - she gives you just enough taste of the gruesomeness and terrifying creatures that inhabit it.For those that have not had the opportunity to read or start the Soul Screamers series I would first say ""WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!"" and then I would recommend that you read at least the first book before reading this prequel.

I also loved how funny she was - telling someone that she was in the institution because she didn't speak, and telling one of the therapists that she was only there because the doors were locked! Loved that one! I really felt for her though. It would kill me to be locked up in an institution somewhere and have people telling me that I was crazy because of circumstances out of my control. How awful to also suddenly start screaming and not be able to stop too! Really awful, and so embarrassing!I thought the storyline here was pretty unique. I've read books before where people know when people are going to die, but I've never come across something like this! I really liked this twist of Kaylee being forced to scream, and I'm really interested to find out what will happen to her in the rest of the series!Overall; an enjoyable and unique start to what promises to be an awesome series!7 out of 10.","06 11, 2013",A3R6PYQRPAZE0K,Sarah,Great,1370908800

When she wakes up, she finds herself in a psych hospital. As she tries to convince everyone she is fine, another patient seems to be curious about who she is. My first audiobook! I would say it was a success. I didn&#8217;t love My Soul to Lose but I really enjoyed it. The narrator could be annoying at times, but she could make the story interesting when it came down to whether I was able to concentrate on the story. I did have a few problems with the narrator&#8217;s voice and how she portrayed the characters. Sometimes I liked the voices she made, but her Kaylee voice annoyed me greatly at times. Which is obviously not a good thing considering the fact that Kaylee is the MC. I did enjoy the storyline and I was a fan of the first Soul Screamers book. I really liked seeing how Vincent portrayed Kaylee&#8217;s first experience as a banshiede. Another qualm I had was with the other patient who was revealed to have an ability at the end. I liked this ability quite a bit and she proved to be an interesting character that showed potential to be in the series in the future or even have her own. I was sad that her reveal was so rushed and it left me feeling confused and I had to rewind the audiobook a bit. I&#8217;m quite pleased with my first delve into the audiobook world and I&#8217;m happy it wasn&#8217;t terrible like I was afraid it would be.Cover Thoughts: It&#8217;s simple, but I don&#8217;t like that snot color green at all.","03 12, 2014",AW1E6CFGWRWRP,"Sarah Johnson ""Vampire and Paranormal Things ...",First Audiobook!,1394582400

People were gushing and raving about this series everywhere and I just couldn't look pass it anymore, so I had to see what it's about.Kaylee is at the mall with her friend Emma and they're trying to figure out a revenge plan on Kaylee's ex as well as shop for homecoming. Then all of a sudden Kaylee feels the urge to scream the heck out of her, because she sees shadows creeping upon a child in a wheelchair and when she starts, she doesn't stop. The next time she's conscious Kaylee realizes she's been commited to a mental hospital. How did it happen and how, when and if she can leave is up for you to find out.The first half of the prequel was intriguing, but I couldn't read more than 5 pages tops every night. My eyelids grew as heavy as rock and I felt like this book didn't attract me at all. I found this whole situation rather confusing and this mental institution just pushed me away even more.However, after complaining about it on Goodreads, I gave myself a promise to finish this ASAP in order to finaly start the real book.

The thing is, she sees shadows. When she sees those shadows, she has the overwhelming urge to scream. Kaylee is afraid that she's losing her mind. But, is she really losing her mind or is it something she will have to learn to live with? This is just the beginning of uncovering a deep family secret.My Take:It's been so fun re-reading this book knowing what I know now! We meet Lydia in this book, then don't see her again until If I Die. I had forgotten she was in the early novella! When I originally read this novella, I read it after I had started the series. This time around, I read this as my start, since after all, this is where it begins! Even though I know the story now and know what happens next, I found myself really anxious to read the next book, My Soul to Take!

This book is very historically accurate, set in post Civil war Texas, and captures the language, attitudes and atmosphere of the time really well.  &#34;Button&#34;, the hero, is a character that gets you on his side quickly, and you see the story unfold purely from his perspective, with no attempt by the author to take the God viewpoint and try to give an overview.  Things happen as seen by Button and when he is surprised, you are as well.  You also know his sympathies and biases as well, but are never quite sure about the other players until they act.  Altogether, one of Henry's better books and a terrific read if you like the genre.  Even if you are just a mystery fan, this is still a very good read.

Her decision to cut loose and celebrate her freedom from the crown and sash has landed her in big trouble.  The simple fact that she wakes up in a stranger's bed wearing nothing but her Miss Firecracker sash with no memory of how she got there is just the beginning of what promises to be a wild week.Wyoming sheepherder Blake West has been at loose ends since his father decided to retire and sell the ranch.  He jumped at the chance to manage his friend's bar in Nebraska while trying to decide what he wants to do with his life.  Blake is a genuinely nice guy but he's also got a domineering side and for Willow, the combination is intoxicating.Willow has always been more of a tomboy than a beauty queen but when a childhood nemesis entered her name into the contest she had too much pride to back out.  In a way she'd kind of hoped she'd learn to be more `feminine' but let's face it, `ladies' don't get drunk and bust up a bar.  The only thing that kept her from a jail cell is a condition she agreed to - to work at the bar until she's earned enough to pay for the damage she caused.Willow's definitely not happy with this situation, but there's no denying she's incredibly attracted to Blake.  When she thanks him for being such a nice guy and not taking advantage of her inebriated state the night before, Blake sets her straight and defuses any notion she has that he's not interested in her sexually.  Blake's only filling in for his friend at the bar for about a week so keeping any relationship they embark on a no-strings attached basis would only make sense, but the more time they spend together the more they realize that what they share is much more than just sex.Lorelei James' WILD WEST BOYS series has a new addition that is hotter than any 4th of July show.  MISS FIRECRACKER had me chuckling at Willow's drunken antics - and I could only imagine how her clothing ended up hanging from the ceiling fan.  Willow and Blake fit together so perfectly that they're a pleasure to read about - especially when you consider their encounters are hot enough to leave you sweating.  Ms. James is a talented author who never fails to thrill readers with her sexy heroes and delightful storylines.If you haven't read MISTRESS CHRISTMAS yet, don't worry, these stories definitely don't need to be read in order.

5365,B002FK3U00,"[0, 0]",4,"Second in the Wild West Boys romance spinoff series from the Rough Riders with this story based in Broward, Nebraska. The couple focus is on Blake West and Willow Gregory.My TakeThis is strictly romance for those of you expecting the erotica from a James story. And it&#8217;s sweet, cute, and very, I dunno, metrosexual?? Is that a word I can use for a guy who is sensitive, sweet, concerned with his health without being obsessive, trying to find himself---and very considerate of the woman he&#8217;s with...oh, yeah.He also takes on the negative characteristics attributed to women: he&#8217;s pissed that he might just be a one-night-stand. Even though that&#8217;s all he had been looking for.It&#8217;s rare to find a romance in which the guy is the softer, gentler half, and this one is it. Blake is amazing in his understanding, in being such a gentleman (when a woman needs him to be), and such a lover when she needs that.I loved the twist James put on this right from the start with a naughty Willow waking up in a strange guy&#8217;s bed. Combine it with Blake&#8217;s reaction, and I&#8217;m all over readin&#8217; it. James also stretched Blake&#8217;s reasons for being in Nebraska out nicely. All those hints and reflections had me wondering what he&#8217;d done wrong.There were a few places where Blake took umbrage, and I didn&#8217;t understand why. Seemed out of character for him. The fact that Dreyfuss was the only person to talk about how attracted all the men in town are to Willow was annoying. Why weren&#8217;t there at least other indications for the readers to be aware of that an obtuse Willow could have not seen?Okay, for all my moaning and whining, I liked the honest communication between Willow and Blake. I did not appreciate Dave&#8217;s entry into the scene. That was clumsy and seemed more mean than anything.LOL, I did like Mandy&#8217;s ploy! And I liked that Willow caught on, to the learning part, and then eventually the truth. Then there was the scene between Blake and Willow&#8217;s dad...ROFLMAO funny.Yeah, who knew? Who knew that a McKay cousin could be so comfortable and attuned to a woman&#8217;s needs out of bed, LOL.&#34;I call you sunshine because you light up my world.&#34;The StoryToo caught up in proving herself, Willow Gregory finally realizes there&#8217;s more to life than work...thanks to so-called friends standing her up.It&#8217;s that humiliation that sets this story crackin&#8217; as Willow lashes out, and the sheriff lashes back. It&#8217;s a week of payback with the ultimate in payoff when Willow meets Blake West, an all-around nice guy who seems to have picked up some ideas from those rowdy, rough McKay cousins.The CharactersWillow Gregory is so not a girl&#8217;s girl and heads up a construction team for Gregory Construction and constantly feels the need to prove herself. Jackson is her younger brother who&#8217;s away at college. Big Kenny is her dad...and they ain&#8217;t kiddin&#8217;...he&#8217;s BIG. Cerise was her best friend, but she&#8217;s married to a soldier and living in Germany.Blake West is at loose ends, trying to find himself, and when his friend, Dave LeRoy, asks for help with his bar, LeRoy&#8217;s Tavern, Blake jumps. Darren West is his dad, and he&#8217;s in rehab for a stroke.Mandy is a hardworking waitress at the bar with a four-year-old daughter, Anya, and a fifteen-year-old sister, Roxy, to take care of; Ginny is not. A hardworking waitress that is.Norbert Fossum is a dirty old man who finally got his comeuppance. Sheriff Mayhew has an unusual approach to mayhem. Destiny is the not-friend who put Willow&#8217;s name up for the pageant. Paul Shulman is a Gregory electrician and the company&#8217;s biggest gossip. Don Dreyfuss owns the International Harvester dealership in town, and knows Willow&#8217;s daddy. Gloria is Dave&#8217;s significant other, if the break-up isn&#8217;t permanent.Catching up...This takes place about a year after Nick and Holly marry and they're expecting a child (see Mistress Christmas , 1).Chronologically, it fits in the Rough Riders series about two weeks after Indy has baby Hudson.The CoverThe cover is cute with its subtle patriotic colors in Willow's sexy, white short shorts along with the blue drill and the red bra top.

She had only entered the contest on a dare anyways, she really isn't the crown and tiara type, give her a carpenters tool belt any day.She defiantly didn't expect the morning to turn out with her waking up th a strangers bed with no memory after arriving at the bar the night before.  Now apparently she has not only spent the night with the hunkiest man she has seen in a long time, but has managed to trash a local bar.  Rather than go to jail she agrees to Blake West's price of working off the price of the repairs.  Especially when she thinks there might just be some fringe benefits.Will Blake's secret ruin all the two build while spending time together? Or will he realize what he might finally have in his sights, and come clean?I have to say I love the exploits of the West boys almost as much as I love their cousins the McKay's.  I continue to find Ms. James writing refreshing and just plain a joy to read and Miss Firecracker is no exception.  I loved how the premise of this story is the aftermath of Willow ""letting loose"" after a year of being a ""good girl"".  As usual expect a few twists and turns as the characters develop, which will lead to a fast paced and fun story.

5374,B002FK3U00,"[1, 2]",4,"Miss Firecracker is the love story of Blake West and Willow, the former Miss Firecracker.  The book begins the morning after Willow's wild night of celebrating the end of her year as Miss Firecracker, a restrictive beauty pageant title that prevented her from dating or other ""wild"" behavior.  Willow did some damage to the bar the night before, and rather than arrest her, or let her pay for it out of her pocket, the sheriff decided she must waitress at the bar, using her tip money to pay for the damages.  Blake West is visiting from out of town, and managing the bar for the owner that is on vacation.  The sparks fly between Blake and Willow from the very start of the book.  Blake sees Willow as a sexy, strong, woman and is not uncomfortable with her position as foreman for the town's construction company, unlike most of the men in town.  Blake is far away from the West/McKay part of Wyoming, so Willow knows nothing about his ""wild McKay cousins.""  Their love story goes quickly, with the conflict and resolution occurring in less than one week.This was a quick read, lasting only a couple hours.  I thought this was a fun read.  However, when comparing it to the Rough Riders books by Ms. James, the love story wasn't nearly as consuming and addictive, I think because it is told so quickly.  This could be read as a standalone, but I think the story is richer if read in the context of knowing about the McKay cousins (who star in the Rough Riders books).  In the Rough Riders books, the McKays all have roles and plots in the story line.  In this book, since Blake is in a distant town, he only mentions the McKay cousins, but you don't actually meet them.If you want some back story on Blake, I would advise reading Rough Riders book number 6, Branded as Trouble before reading Miss Firecracker.  Unlike many reviewers, I believe the Rough Riders books can be read out of sequence, because that was what I did.  I read one of the later books, fell in love with the McKay/West family and the Rough Riders series, and have since read most of the Rough Riders books.  There is another West boy story, Mistress Christmas that occurs chronologically before Miss Firecracker.  I read the West boy books out of sequence, and feel that it is fine to read Miss Firecracker without reading Mistress Christmas. Though, Mistress Christmas is so good, I think you'd enjoy reading that one.  If you would like both stories in a paper format, check out the bookWild West Boys, it contains Mistress Christmas and Miss Firecracker. I've read most of the books about the McKay/West family, so if you're curious you can read more about them in my other reviews.","05 18, 2011",A1WEGF26C76IBT,STL Chick,A good short story about Blake West and his Miss Firecracker,1305676800

I like reading series just for that reason.  Here we find out more about the vampire world where in the last book the focus was on the Were creatures.  Also there is more of a certain fey knight that makes one wonder about upcoming developments.Be aware that the sex is liberal and a major part of this world culture, which I like.

I really enjoyed the first book where we also met Dante and Duncan for the first time.  Dante is the ultimate sexy good guy.  Megan is a part werewolf trying to ""work off"" an old family blood debt to clear her family's name and bring honor back to them, but got tricked in to giving her allegiance to the wrong people.  They in turn force her to do many questionable things.  Her supposed final task is to spy on Dante and find out what happened to a dark mage (enemy from the 1st book) and report back.  She and Dante fall in love and he and his good friend Duncan basically have to help undo the spells and compulsions that were put on her by the enemies, in order for them to move forward in their new relationship.  They also have to continue fighting against some ancient dark enemies that are striving to return to this world and take over.  All this while trying to figure out how the dynamics of their relationship will work, as in the past it's been forbidden...a Vampire mating with someone of ""her"" origins (can't spoil it by saying what they discover she is!!).  That's just a basic overview.  Lots of discoveries and fun details....read it~~I really appreciate when an author can bring two people together in a story early on and work out their ""secrets"" and ""misunderstandings"" right off the bat so they can continue as a team and fight the bad guys.  It saves so much angst in the whole process.  Readers don't always like to read the whole story of two peoples' suffering so they can get together in the last 5 pages of the book.  This book was fantastic!  Dante and Megan were a perfect match.  Both strong and independent while each equally able to trust and submit to the other.  Great fight scenes, as well as love scenes!  Powerful and realistic.  Loved it!!","07 24, 2009",A24G8GSONF0GMB,"Liz ""Liz""",Inferno!!!,1248393600
5384,B002FK3U0A,"[2, 2]",3,"I'm conflicted about this book.  Don't misunderstand me about the surprise on reviews, I do like the book.  However, the continuity and details made it very hard for me to give this a good rating.  Fey have long life expectancy from what the first book states.  Sorry for the spoiler, but I'm stating this because it IS in the first book.  Betina is proof of that.  Although, I think because she is High Priestess and Fey, it makes her life expectancy a tad longer.  But Duncan is also half Fey, and he has a long life too.  Then there is the fact of what Megan is.  I won't spoil it, but the fact it is stated she is mortal: makes no sense!  She should be just as supernatural as the next.  She is what she is: mixed, but that doesn't make her any less supernatural.Aside from that, I sort of like Dante. I was more into Duncan in this one.  From what I could tell his character takes the magic aspect like Allie and Betina did.  My other issue is Duncan not using flashing them to safety.  Uh, what happened to that ability?  Did he lose that yet still conjures up glowing swords?  And the bit about using something as means to get rid of poison?  Why is it in the first book, this was not used?  Silver is just as much a poison to vampires and weres and there was no need for what Duncan says helps rid poison from their body.  It was inconsistent to the first book.  Or maybe just an excuse to have multiple partners, but still make this a book on a couple.  I'm going to say yes it was used just for that.  Which is just plain horrible to use Duncan in this sense.  He was imprisoned and released in the previous book by Allie...yet he is used in this one.  Kinda horrible that he couldn't find happiness in this book especially considering a detail that is found out about a character.  I just think he got short changed BIG TIME.  Then again he deserves better.Megan.  What to say about her.  I liked her, but I didn't love her like I adored Allie.  She is constantly back and forth with feelings.  Let me emphasize.  She makes it very clear she feels something for Dante at some point.  Won't say when.  But right away you can tell B. D'arc is making this only about two of the characters and not a trio.  However, she does throw in the sharing aspect quite a bit.  At which point pisses me off at times.  Inner voices are basically laying down just who that couple should be.  Yet, you wonder about the one character who saves them continuously.  I just don't understand why this couldn't have included Duncan also. Given how close Dante and Duncan are. And don't get me wrong I get being a good friend, but that?  Yeah, that was taking the friendship to an entirely different level.  Sure they were mature about it, but it squeaked me out more than the twin brothers in the first book. I got that, and even excepted it.  This? I don't know, unless at some point she plans to make books about what Duncan's character actually is.  It's stated in the first book that he is a Knight and half Fey.  So maybe a bunch of Knights and half Fey or Knights and Fey get there own set of books aside from this series?  Because it seems to me we won't see Duncan getting his own book anytime soon.  So yeah, he was written in a way that he was used big time.  Aggravated me.  Probably why it's taking me so long to read this.  It's losing my interest.  And probably because I saw better chemistry when all three were together, but hey, just my opinion, I guess.I didn't find this book as hot as the first and I'm not a big fan of twins with the same woman.But I'm not finished and pushing through this book even though I'm not as immersed as I was with the first.  So I will update.Update:The inconsistencies are a big problem for me.  Another is the very fact she discusses not using the backdoor during sex...yet she has done this.  It's like the act is happening for the very first time at every sexual interaction they have.  It's highly annoying.  I'm surprised no one noticed this at all.  Another spoiler from the last book.  Don't read this unless you've read the first.  But my issue is that there is so much emphasis on the fact Dante got rid of a character that is of importance to a family in this one, yet he aided.  It was Allie the Priestess who banished that character whom Dante is being blamed for.  That was a very big pet peeve how that wasn't argued with the bad villains of the story.  They knew what Patrick was up to, yet they don't follow through and assume it's Dante?  Dante helped, along with Duncan, but it was ultimately Allie who banished this Patrick.  This character is the reason behind a revenge vendetta against Dante.  I understand why they think it's him...BUT they are so wrong.  And why when it does get pointed out it wasn't him, it's brushed off.  I get the reasons for going after Dante, because I won't say that spoiler, but seriously they needed to go to the source too.  (maybe this will come up in later books, I hope?)Too many things just weren't consistent with the truth of the first book.  I had a very hard time with a certain joining too.  There was nothing spectacular about it.  Just words spoken of We are one.  Yet, Dante shares a bond with Tim from the first book and even more so with Duncan from the first book and even this book.  I'm going to spoil this right now so read at your own discretion: But given there was sex between Duncan, Megan, and Dante at one point.  To control Dante's urge to feed he bit Duncan.  Um, I've read quite a few vampire bonding books, but this was very very weak.  It would mean that Dante bonded with anyone he slept with.  This one business was, too me, a cop out.  Automatically joining them.  I didn't find it romantic at all.  I found it too convenient so that it was just the two.  As I'm sure it was intended to begin with.  I really wished I did find it romantic and a great joining, but I didn't.  But this book wasn't anywhere in the same caliber as the first of this series.  That joining between Tim/Allie/Rafe was believable.  I kinda want to grab Duncan out of this book and give him something 100 times better than these two.  D'arc definitely throws him to the side, but loves to tell you the reader that he's okay with it.  I wouldn't have been.  I still have an issue that she changed how magic users rid poison.  It just didn't fit.  I still believe it was to add the spice of multiple partners.  Because come on!  How the heck can a poisoned nearly dying vamp manage to have sex????  Yeah I'm not going to totally spill on that scene, but seriously?  It makes you wonder how this technique of ridding poison wasn't used in Lord's of the Were when Duncan shows up.  I'm just stumped how details can change so quickly from each book.  Yes, I'm into details and certain details done jive with the first book.Final Update:I'm hoping this isn't the case with the rest of the Were series because I totally loved the first book!  And now finishing this story...finally, I'm still very much conflicted.  A lot didn't add up to the previous book.  I wonder how the ending will come about if we don't see much of a certain character being tagged by a certain familiar.  The joining between these two Dante and Megan, was kinda cheesy and way too romanticized to be believable at times.  And I'm still smarting about the fact that she needs to be something else.  She is part something, part were, and part human.  She should have long life expectancy, yet I think we are to assume she doesn't, which negates what we read in the first book.  I just don't get that.  Some things with these details just boggled my mind.  I'm sorry I tried to like this story.  A lot of it was telling with some bits of it showing then right back to telling. I don't know some things were contradicting the first story and then this one takes on a new leaf, so to speak.  I get making two characters the be all, but it was overly done. Kinda like without you, we are so dead, it's up to these two. Yet, when it was done for the Lords of the Were, it was tastefully done.  It worked. For these two it was pushed and pushed.  You find yourself really pulling for another trio to come together, but it's NOT going to happen.  Yet, he does MORE heroic and amazing things during this entire book, and he amazed me the most aside from some special characters that came on the scene!  I was not connecting well with Megan or Dante in this story.  I swear even with the first part of the book, I wanted Duncan to find his happiness.  And, at this point, I don't think we will see it any time soon.  Unless of course it's thrown in there in later stories just to conclude his part in all of this.  Rather sad, because I connected so much to him in the first book and this book.No doubt most won't agree with me, but the details killed me.  Given the fact that I'm into details, this was disappointing because I do like Bianca's work.  I hope to enjoy the rest of the series.  I recommend read if you aren't a detail wolf like me (lol), but I am not like the others with their praise for this book.  I failed to review the last book, because I wanted to read this one.  And I don't review every book either.  This one I had to say something.  I was really into Dante in the first book.  This one he literally died in my eyes.  No connection. So yeah, disappointment.

5391,B002FK3U0K,"[3, 3]",5,"I'm too old and it's too much time I'm around. Or maybe it's only that I read too much. Z.A. Maxfiled wrote a parody about a man who wrote a parody... I think I'm able to recognize to whom Z.A. Maxfield identifies herself in the novel, enough to say it's not the writer (too simple), and I recognized who was the writer she is paying homage to.The story is actually a comedy of errors: Jae is a literary critic working for an LGBT Magazine, The Adversary (quite clear reference to The Advocate...); Jae is an half Caucasian half Asian man, and his full name is Jae-sun, but he goes for Jae, and this sometime leads people to think that he is a female. Often writers who are pissed off from one of his reviews accuse him to be a woman, and so to being unable to understand a real good piece of Gay Literature. You would think that Jae would be the first to defend himself claiming that he is a man, and instead he has always let it go, finding useful to have the change to play the double role, male or female when it is necessary. Like in this case: Jae is real angry since a woman, Kelly Kendall, dared to write a parody of one of Jae's favourite coming of age novel, Doorways. Doorways was like The Sorrows of Young Werther or some other breaking coming of age novel for Jae, and seeing a trashy novel like Windows taking and ridiculing it, it's too much. Above all since the author who did it is a woman! (payback is hard to digest...) How does she dare? She can't understand how important that book was for young Jae.Problem is that Kelly can truly understand, since he is not a ""she"", he is Kelly Mackay, alias Kelly Kendall, alias Kieran Anders, the author of both Doorways than Windows. He wrote Windows to fulfil a bet with Will, his houseboy / dogs boy, a 20 years old former hustler who he welcomed in his home as secretary and buddy friend with benefits. Where Kelly was probably the angst teenager in Doorways, Will is probably the slut teenager in Windows... they are two different perspective on the same story, and Kelly is also probably overgrown on the teenager he was. At this point I also recognized another gentle homage Z.A. Maxfield probably did, to the movie Finding Forrester; not only Kelly Kendall has the same Irish/Scottish origin of the character in the movie, William Forrester, but he has also the same problem to being trapped by his first novel: people adore Doorways so much, that Kelly is scared to writing something else. To do so, he changed completely the genre and went under another pseudo. Plus Kelly suffers of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and he avoids like a plague everything that is not ordinary or stranger.Jae is bent on ""outing"" Kelly Kendall as not only a woman (his publisher maintains the mystery around him) but also a plagiarist. He starts to pestering Kelly with emails from a supposedly female fan, StrawberryFields, mails to which Kelly replies with gentleness but avoiding giving details. Only that, email after email, both Jae than Kelly start to realize that they have much in common, and that they like to talk with the other online... is it possible that a so good online relationship turns in something real? Yes, it's, since Jae is used to have things to easily, and dating Kelly it's not easy at all. Someone could say that Kelly is a nut case, but I think that he is only a very special man, and he needs someone to take care of him. Don't get me wrong, Kelly is not retarded or similar, he is only a man with a lot of odd customs, but it's what makes him a special man, and he has not to change; he only has to find a man who can deal with him. And learning to deal with Kelly maybe will teach to Jae to see things less in Black and White, to see the shades, to be more flexible, and learning that, to be a better man. Not always being a crusader is a good thing, sometime crusade did a very poor job to humanity.When I said that being a crusader is not necessarily a good thing, I'm not only referring to Jae's fight to ""out"" everyone who hides his homosexuality (which negative side we read in the fate of an actor at the beginning of the book); take Kelly's OCD... someone like Jae, so strong and used to see only the right and the wrong, probably would try to cure himself, to force nature to submit to human's will... and doing so you would destroy the real Kelly. The real Kelly it's not the ""healthy"" man, the real Kelly is the obsessed one, the troubling one, he is special since he is not normal, level him to the rest of the world, means to kill him.I like also as the author dealt with Kelly and Will's relationship; true, they are having a sexual relationship, but not from Kelly's side or Will's one there is a real emotional commitment. Both of them know that what is between them it's not real love, problem is that Kelly doesn't know if real love exist, at least not until Jae. I like that, even if at the beginning the author let us in the more intimate details between Kelly and Will, when Jae is becoming something more than an email address for Kelly, that relationship slowly but steadily turns in a real friendship, without benefits. It's made in a way that I don't feel bad for Will, on the contrary, I believe that he needs more Kelly as a friend rather than as a lover. Not only Kelly finds his love, but it happens at the same time when Will's past is revealed (a past of child molestation), and in a strange play of destiny, it's actually a better thing for him that Kelly, who can be a fatherly figure for Will due to the age difference, becomes totally sexually detached.","07 7, 2009",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,ePistols at Dawn by Z.A.

It was slow paced and kind of boring at times, but it also managed to make me smile now and then.It was not an entirely boring or bad read, but nevertheless, it didn't really manage to capture my interest all that much. I didn't feel the urge to read the book in order to find out what happens next, what will happen to those two MCs. I just wasn't caught up in this book.Jae and Kelly were, on some level, interesting characters, well, interesting enough, at least. They're likable. I liked the fact that Kelly suffered from OCD, it was a good idea--attempt--, but it lacked believability at times. In my opinion, the research (by the author) on that topic fell a bit flat.And it's more or less the same with Jae's asthma: One time he's running like hell after Kelly and his ever-present sidekick Will which leads to ""the worst asthma attack Jae has had for a very long time"". So far, so good. Not quite realistic, however, is that Jae, while practically choking, can still have a conversation with Kelly at the same time. Well...There were some other things that weren't quite believable or that bothered me, but I won't list them all here. The ones above are enough. ;)The developing relationship between Kelly and Jae is sweet, I guess. I even like the houseboy-boy-toy Will, although he was annoying, sometimes.It was a nice enough read and I can't really say that I didn't like the characters or the plot itself, but the book never really was engaging enough, though.

Kelly and Jae knew each other better than they thought they did thanks to those emails, otherwise I would be saying the sex and &#34; love you's&#34; came too fast. Something that was pointed out in another review was that Kelly took advantage of Will's past. Yes, Will was abused but Kelly didn't know about it until after sex had pretty much stopped between them. Also, Will mentioned wanting someone to &#34;save&#34; him, and maybe Will saw Kelly as that person and found comfort and not resentment in the nature of the relationship.I would have liked to see more of Jae's family, just for te humor of all of the angry Asian women he talked about... would have lightened up the book some. It had its angst, but nothing I felt was overplayed. The feelings were organic.I did become slightly... fed up with the on-again off-agin part. One thing would arise and one of them would run off, and a few weeks later they were together again... maybe three or four times.

5394,B002FK3U0K,"[7, 9]",3,"So far I am batting 0-3 for ZA Maxfield's books and writing positive reviews. I bought this book because of the stellar reviews here and on other sites and for the most part I enjoyed reading the book, but there are issues. First, the good things. The relationship between Jae and Kelly is unique and once it gets going is fun, original and hot. I like that Kelly has some quirks - OCD, his fear of leaving his house, and his obsession with Jae's hair. Z.A. Maxfield's characters in this book are crisp, three dimensional and entertaining. I also liked Will, Jae's ""houseboy,"" who I hope gets his own book. His backstory was full of heartbreak, but his strength and love for Kelly was a great part of the book. Those are the things I liked about ""ePistols at Dawn,"" now onto the things that made me give it only a 3-star rating.The first 60 pages of the book dragged - badly. I almost gave up on reading it. Too many e-mails between Kelly and Jae and too much sex between Will and Jae. At first I thought this was going to be a love story about Will and Kelly a la ""Pretty Woman,"" not Jae and Kelly. I would have liked it better if Will had just been Kelly's roommate and not his ""houseboy."" Second, the subplot about Windows and Doorways also dragged on for too long. The secret that Kelly was the author of both should have been revealed much sooner. Third, there were consent issues between Will and Kelly that made alarm bells go off in my head once it was revealed that Will was sexually abused by his stepfather, had run away from home to become a hooker, and was ""given"" to Kelly by a friend as a houseboy/lover who was leaving LA and couldn't take care of Will any longer. That subplot made me dislike Kelly for the last half of the book. Who basically forces a damaged child (Will would have been 19 when he went to live with Kelly who is in his mid-to-late 30's) to clean his house and have sex with him as payment to live there? That aspect of the book left a very bad taste in my mouth. I know the whole ""houseboy and all-around slut"" thing was supposed to be humorous, I did not find it so. Maxfield should have had Will and Kelly just as roommates, as the dubious consent issues in that relationship were irritating.So, while there were aspects of ""ePistols at Dawn"" I did enjoy, I cannot give it a ringing endorsement.","02 4, 2010",A11F5KW6QXHL8L,Lasha,Disappointed,1265241600
5395,B002FK3U0K,"[8, 8]",4,"Whoever thought turning an iconic book into good smut certainly didn't pass the idea by reporter Jae Fields and he's pissed about it. Jae feels very strongly about the original gay coming of age tale and is determined to expose the comic writer as nothing but a heterosexual, female fraud treading on the honest emotions of gay men and their hot sex. What turns into a harmless crusade ends up becoming much more as Jae discovers the writer is not only a gay male like himself, but none other than the author of the original book. The web of lies increases with both men to create a touchy atmosphere as feelings deepen and Jae and Kelly must evaluate what is most important to them.This is a highly angst-filled story that uses the ""big misunderstanding"" theme not once but twice. However, the writing is subtle and deft enough to pull off both problems with only a slight annoyance at the inclusion of the second. The relationship and characterization of the men are strong enough to overcome this problem for most readers. The story at the heart is about two men who have a lot of fears and problems but overcome their respective mistakes and let go of the past to take a chance on their future, together. The emotional and sexual connection of the main characters, Jae and Kelly, is solid and beautifully drawn as the two struggle with their problems. Both men have problems and neither is perfect, yet the strong connection is enough for them to take a chance and risk for a potential happy ending.Kelly is the more dynamic of the two characters with his myriad of emotional and physical problems from an inability to have sex with socks to a potentially debilitating OCD condition. Despite these problems, Kelly has a deeply vulnerable heart, thrust for life and experience, and a kindness that endears him to the reader instantly. His shy needy personality is offset by a strength of will in overcoming his problems and fears when needed. Especially moving and wonderful is his connection and relationship to his houseboy and all around slut Will. Their dialogue and scenes together were the highlight of the book with humor, intelligence, and wit. They almost overshadowed Jae and Kelly's relationship but Kelly was always clear on his passion and desire for Jae above all else. Jae's compassion and understanding is essential in helping Kelly and creating a life with the complicated man and his dishonest mistakes stem from immaturity and poor decisions.I had some trouble with Jae's decisions and his inconsistent character with regards to honesty (or lack thereof), so I didn't connect or sympathize with Jae as much as I did Kelly. Jae's mistakes and hurtful actions towards Kelly could have been stopped but Jae refused to do so mostly for selfish reasons. Due to the lengthy time the story spends on Jae, his actions, and motivations, this led to an overall feeling that the book is good but not great. If the story had focused on Kelly and their relationship more without the trappings of Jae's job, the internal conflict is enough to hold interest but even so this is a good story. Most readers will enjoy the struggle and rocky path on the road to true love, even with the few missteps of writing and characters alike.

Kelly enjoys his life as a recluse and having Will around makes life better than Kelly expected.  However, Kelly has secrets from the world, and although Will shares them, Kelly is determined to keep them safely hidden.  As the author of the acclaimed Doorways, Kelly has managed to keep his identity hidden from the world, but when he writes a parody of Doorways called Windows on a dare from Will, it attracts all sorts of attention - attention that Kelly doesn't want.Jae-sun Fields is incensed that someone would dare write a parody of the beloved coming-of-age novel Doorways.  Working for the gossip rag The Adversary, Jae sets out to find and expose the awful woman, who is surely the culprit, of such desecration of his favorite novel.  However, as his investigation progresses he finds Kelly MacKay, who seems more than tangentially connected to his quest.  But what will Jae do with the information he finds?As Jae and Kelly continually meet, more than information is found.  Kelly is immensely attracted to Jae, but fears what such a connection might mean to his self-circumscribed isolation.  Jae wants to pursue Kelly for information, but also to satisfy his curiosity about the attraction between them.  Can both of these men make it work?ePistols at Dawn is a great emotional read that delves into the mysteries of the human mind and what it means to be gay in a not so accepting society.  Jae is a wonderfully funny character with his determination to find his nemesis and his ire at the desecration of his favorite book.  Kelly is so full of quirks that it is almost too much to deal with, but Z.A. Maxfield makes him a likeable character when she uses Will as a source of reality and mocking that slowly pushes Kelly to emerge from his shell.  As the story progresses it is sometimes hard to like Jae for his actions, but his ethics win in the end, making him a better man.  Kelly, on the other hand, is crippled by his OCD and fear of being found out as the author of such a revered work that he believes to be the product of such a self flagellation exercise.  Even as the relationship between Kelly and Jae is plagued by pot-holes in the road of love, their coming together in the end finds them both being better men for all their suffering.  As expected Z.A. Maxfield presents characters and situations that will pull you into the story and reading the book all in one sitting.

I loved the main male characters, Jae, Kelly and Will, & the complexity with which each character was drawn:  Kelly struggling with all his fears and uncertainty who at the same time was a very brave and loving man, Jae struggling with his conscience over issues of personal honesty and changing feelings about his line of work, and Will, struggling to recover from a past that has left him emotionally damaged and to learn to let go of the safe haven he's found with Kelly.

5400,B002FK3U0K,"[1, 1]",5,"A fabulously complex, richly drawn, and character driven love story that cements Z. A. Maxfield as one of my favorite authors across all genres of books. This book was an absolutely delightful experience!I was extremely impressed and pleased with the depth of character and emotion in this book. Maxfield has penned characters with complex motivations and actions. I very much enjoyed my time with them.Kelly is a funny, caring, wonderful man who struggles with agoraphobia and OCD related quirks, bears the brutal and hopeless weight of a mother with Alzheimer's, and has spent years keeping himself segregated personally AND professionally from everyone in the world, save one, his right hand (in ALL things), Will. And Will is a splendidly fantastic, deeply caring, funny, sharp-tongued, and protective young man who has deep emotional scars and bears his own crosses. His childhood and adolescence was a painful, heartbreaking experience that understandably still affects his actions and personality.They live together, love together - and yet they aren't destined for each other. They each know it, so instead of being tragic, their relationship is...wonderfully complicated and delightfully simple as well. Maxfield has shown us the depth of a different sort of love two men can have for each other, and it's comforting and good.And then there's Jae. Tall. Half-asian. Hot. And a journalist for a rag that makes its bread and butter from the sort of stories that rip privacy away from people in the public eye. A guy who's dealing with his own loneliness and guilt for the actions not taken with a boyfriend in the public eye who kills himself.Jae's sort of got the worst POSSIBLE job, not to mention his own inherent curiosity, to have any hope with the massively reclusive Kelly - and while he may not get the depth of just how bad it is when he first meets Kelly, he realizes it relatively quickly, and is so torn between his interest in the man and the job he's got to do that he makes mistake after mistake in trying to walk the line between both. Not that he's the only one to make mistakes, by any means. Kelly's human too.And actually, that's one of the things I loved most about this book - everyone was so wonderfully and wildly human. ePistols at Dawn is at turns funny, heartbreaking, surprising, loving, and erotic.Enjoy!","08 1, 2009",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",What a Wonderful Experience!,1249084800

Just like Tommy, nothing in this place ""was what it seemed, nothing was permanent, and so much was concealed.""

5423,B002FSTJOS,"[0, 0]",4,"Lords of the Underworld is one of my favorite PNR series. When I started it, I did not know about the short novellas between some of the books. The Darkest Prison is the first novella right after Reyes and Danika's story in The Darkest Pleasure (they have a cameo at the very beginning actually). The book follows Atlas and Nike, god and goddess of Strength. The way it starts really has you questioning the romance between these two. I honestly thought I read the synopsis wrong because they did not like each other at all.We find out very quickly that Atlas is quite the ass. I did not like him because he basically acted like a scorned frat boy. Nike hates him because he used her and threw aside like trash. But Atlas finds that once Nike is in a cage with her ex-fiance, they both try to one up the other even though Atlas says he doesn't even find Nike attractive.I love seeing how their hate for each other developed into something past lust. They both stopped being stubborn and/or forget the past and saw they were the perfect match. I especially loved how Atlas changed his views of Nike and didn't treat her like the prisoner he kept her as. Even though it might get him in trouble with Cronus who doesn't care at all for his Greek prisoners (duh). Not to mention that ending. It really put a smile on my face. Nike puts the bad in badass.Nonetheless, this was a fun and sexy short read. It can be read without reading the main books in the series, but I wouldn't recommend that. This series is too good to read halfway and you will be missing out on some amazing and very gorgeous men.

When I read the product description, I had to purchase it and the price was definitely right to take a chance on an author I was unfamiliar with.The premise of the story is that a new technological device has come along - the Gizmo - that does everything.  It's a phone, an MP3-type device and an eReader all combined into one handy gadget.  The comparisons to Amazon's own Kindle are obvious but with even more capability than just reading books.  Everyone in America has one of these handy dandy devices and just what does that mean for the bookstores selling traditional, paper books?  In our narrative, that means the demise of the bookshop and they are slowing closing with only a handful remaining.  Throughout the novel, they close one by one until only ""The Firebreathing Dragon"" remains.  How has it managed to not only stay open but make a tidy profit along the way, providing the financial support for the owner and two employees?  We find out when the owner dies and passes along not the bookstore and his home to his long-lost nephew.  The nephew and his wife come to Eureka, California to see what's what and discover a town filled with interesting characters and a culture vastly different than the one they left behind in the big city.  Should they give up the fast-paced lifestyle which has left them in debt up to their ears to continue running the quirky bookstore or should they sell and take the money?  Just how much is the bookstore making and how are they making anything in this out-of-the-way hamlet?  All these questions and more get answered.  In addition, the exploration of how this situation has evolved and the implication to the reading public will get the reader thinking about this very possibility.For originality and writing style, I definitely give this novel kudos.  A novel that I finished many days ago but still haunts me with the idea of an alternative world I am not too crazy about.  The setting of Eureka is described very well and the town itself becomes an intricate part of the work.  The number of characters is just about perfect - enough to give the story life but not enough to overwhelm the reader.  The characters themselves are quirky and interesting and I wanted to know more about them.  This is where the novel lost one star for me:  the characters weren't developed as much as I would have hoped.

However, I could really see this as a possible future...easily.The novel started off with some very interesting opening chapters. The author did a terrific job of setting the stage for the story. A few portions, such as the marital advice from Emily's mother, almost had me laughing out loud.Unfortunately, once the stage was set, the story just didn't live up to its promise. It just kind of limped along, struggling to make too many points. There were some interesting segments, with plenty of humor thrown in, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the exceptionally weak plot and storyline.The plot was spread out over too many side stories to maintain my interest. The saving grace of this book was the humor and the setting.Character Development: 3 1/2 StarsLewis and Emily were adequately developed, if a little simplistic. My favorite character was the author, Richmond, that worked in the bookstore. With only a relatively small part, he was still the most realistic character and had the most depth.Writing Style: 5 StarsPeople will want to read this book just for the writing style.

The dialogue was exceptionally well done with tremendous voice and realism.Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 StarsThere were a few editing errors, all of which were missing words, those little words that are easy to overlook when editing, like ""for,"" ""and,"" and ""then.""The formatting was of professional quality.Rating: PG-14 for Language and Drug Use","02 18, 2010",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,Original,1266451200

5461,B002G1YGTC,"[0, 0]",4,"After three decades of teaching High School English, Jesse Ashworth decides to take early retirement and move back to his hometown of Bath, Maine.  His longtime friend and colleague, Rhonda Shepard, had moved to Bath a year earlier and opened a gift shop.  Business is good and Jesse divides his time between helping Rhonda at the shop, getting settled in to his new home, spending ""quality"" time with his pug, Argus, and becoming reacquainted with people he knew back in High School.  After some initial trepidation, Jesse finds that retirement suits him just fine.Just as Jesse is settling into a comfortable routine, he makes a grizzly discovery in his back yard:  the skeletal remains of a young woman who died under suspicious circumstances.  The upside?  Jesse gets to work closely with the very attractive Chief of Police, Tim Mallory.  The downside?  It doesn't take long for Jesse to come to the conclusion that someone he knows is a murderer, and that ""someone"" may just have it in for Jesse himself.This is definitely a ""cozy"" mystery, with the mystery part of the storyline taking a backseat to the characters themselves and the domestic details.  Here's what I look for in a ""cozy"":  (1)  An interesting and unique protagonist; someone I can relate to.  (2)  A strong sense of place.  I want to really get a feel for the setting; I want the location to come alive for me.  (3)  While I'm willing to give ""cozy"" writers a lot of leeway when it comes to the mystery itself, I expect it to be at least respectably plausible.  I'm happy to say that this story had a lot of what I enjoy reading in a ""cozy"" mystery.Jesse's first person narrative really worked.  He's observant and witty with a little snark thrown in for good measure.  I know this area of Maine quite well and I love it, so I really enjoyed the way the author worked ""real life"" details into his fictional story.  In fact, I have a craving for one of Amato's Italian sandwiches - Thanks a lot Mr. Stanley, there goes the diet!  Seriously, if you are familiar with Bath then you'll appreciate the details and if you're not you'll want to go there and see it for yourself.  I also really liked the  way the over 50 crowd was well represented, and (Thank You God)  not portrayed as old geezers lucky to be standing on the right side of the grass.  Nope, Jesse and company are attractive, interesting and relevant.Still, I did waffle between a 3 and 4 star rating, settling on a 3.5 (rounded up to 4 for Amazon).  While I enjoyed this very much, there's no getting around the fact that there were numerous ""typos"" - missing words, misspellings, etc - that required a bit of mental editing on my part as I was reading.  Maybe not a big deal, but anytime you are pulled out of a story -especially a Mystery - it's not a good thing.  There were a few places where the dialog could have flowed more naturally but overall I enjoyed this and plan on reading the next installment.Bottom Line:  A solid ""cozy"" mystery with good characterization and plenty of authentic atmosphere.  The mystery is serviceable, but if you're looking for plot holes, you will find them.  There are editing issues.  There is occasional strong language and while there is no sexual content, a same sex romance is depicted.  If that bothers you then this probably isn't the book for you.Book One:A Midcoast MurderBook Two:Murder in the Choir Room (A Jesse Ashworth Mystery)Book Three:The Big Boys' Detective Agency","07 7, 2012",A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,"L.

5463,B002G1YGTC,"[0, 0]",3,"Here we have a great premise for a series, with the retired schoolteacher and the small-town cop banding together to solve mysteries, and I appreciated the picture-postcard Maine setting as well. However, I think the book shows its roots as a first novel----it isn't badly written, but could use a little more polish. (And really, an editor should have told the author to remove just about every exclamation point from this manuscript---as a rule, I would say that novels simply shouldn't contain too many exclamation points---practically NONE, in fact, unless they're used in dialogue.)Now, this is a solid mystery, and not a romance---no love scenes here. And that's fine---however, I think a definite shortcoming of the book was the lack of ALL emotional content. It's as if the author is uncomfortable with writing about relationships. I've read other gay-themed mysteries that focus on a decent whodunnit while also delving into the private life of the main characters, and they've been quite satisfying. The complete lack of detail regarding the relationship between Jesse and Tim in this book is rather off-putting, actually, and difficult to understand.It's a great set-up for some decent drama---here you have two old school acquaintances getting to know one another again after thirty-five years. But the way the book handles their initial hook-up is baffling: Tim comes over to dinner at Jesse's place one evening, without Jesse even knowing Tim is gay---and then there's a jump-cut to the next morning with Tim coming out of Jesse's shower, and apparently they're now a couple. What the heck??! This would have been a great opportunity for a long dialogue scene which could have been played in any number of different ways. No, I'm not asking for a sex scene---but I would like to know how these two ended up together, what they said to one another---there is NOTHING in the text to indicate how this played out.Likewise, a little later in the plot Tim's eighteen-year-old daughter comes home from visiting her mother and finds Jesse at Tim's place. Suddenly she not only finds out her father is gay, but that he's actively involved with another man----great opportunity for drama, no? Well---apparently not---because once again this is never explored---we never do get to know what happens, how she reacts.So for me this is a problem---I'm not asking for the novel to turn into a torrid romance, and I have no problem at all about there being zero explicit content. But I would like to know a little more about the relationship of the protagonists, how it develops and plays out; I'd like a little more emotional content in the book, in addition to the mystery. So, as such I wasn't really satisfied with this in the end, and I'm giving it a mixed review.This is the first of several mysteries in a series, and I am curious to know what happens next---and if the author's writing style shows any development. But, I'm not sure whether I want to continue if the other books also ignore the relationship as thoroughly as this one did.","04 18, 2013",A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,octobercountry,Great premise with problematic execution,1366243200

5467,B002G1ZTCU,"[1, 2]",4,"MadnessLet me start off by getting the bad news out of the way, telling you what issues I had with Madness, by Sorcha MacMurrough:Sweet Lord, the spelling errors!  I am more than willing to forgive an error or two in a good book.  It can even be fun to spot them, it makes you feel clever and perceptive.  Not so in Madness, there were so many, many errors that it became more of a challenge to try to ignore them!  I was seriously disappointed by this because it knocked what could have been a great book down to just a good book, if your willing to overlook the mistakes.Editors, help!  There were a few charactors whom could have done with more development, less repetition.  Along the same lines, I felt like the book could have lost a few chapters, sped things along and been made better for it.  Also, I have to say that I wish addiction and mental illness could be addressed in reality as simply as it is in this book.  Not that this aspect was handled badly, just that it contradicts conventional understanding of both topics.  Its simplified, I guess I would say.  My final complaint is the ending... without giving anything away, I will say that there are some remarkable coincidences and unimaginable good luck.  Something more practical may have been better.Now, all of that being said, I did enjoy this book.  I can honestly say that this book is very different from other romance novels I've read.  For one thing, the main female character, Gabrielle, is the hero of the story.  She literally and figuratively rescues her man, Simon.  Gabrielle is a strong, determined, hard working woman who knows her own mind.  She is not afraid to do what she has to in order to protect the people she loves.  She isn't afraid to go against conventional society norms and make choices and decisions that are right for her, what will make her happy.  Gabrielle was resourceful and stubborn in an endearing way.  She was the kind of character that you wanted to see happy at the end of the story.As for the Hero of the book, Simon... What can I say?  Simon is the kind of man every girl wants to find and keep forever.  Simon is smart, strong, handsome, loyal but with horrors in his past and demons that only his Lady Love can help him overcome.  Simon was passionate, sweet, thoughtful, brave and absolutely devoted to his Lady.  He has an insatiable love and lust for Gabrielle and he is determined to fight to transform himself into the kind of man who is worthy of her love.  One thing that I really appreciated about this story is the fact that Simon's intelligence was celebrated instead of down played or perceived as a weakness.  He's a hot hunk of man, but with a brain and a huge heart.While the physical relationship between Gabrielle and Simon doesn't begin immediately, once it begins... its on!  There was A LOT of sex in this story.  Tastefully done but abundant. The plus side to this, perhaps, is that the love that Gabrielle and Simon feel for one another is obvious and sweet, which for me made the banquet of sex less pointless or tedious.I would recommend this book to friends, with the aforementioned caution on the spelling and grammar errors.  If the small issues I mentioned were fixed, I would have given this book 5 stars.  The characters and the love they shared was solid gold, the story was interesting and manages to draw you into the dark corners that these characters visit, then usher you back to the light with the love they discover with one another.  Madness was worth the read, good enough that I'm not going to include a pun based on the title in my review.","09 25, 2012",A147V6V6ELLV40,A. McNulty,Brace Yourself,1348531200

And all this is taking place with her cousin, the Doctor, sleeping within a few feet of them along with her sister(Lucinda)who is comatose due to a beating and near rape by a wild patient.Not once does Gabrielle get up to check on her sister...just keeps playing the virgin wannabe slut with Simon.

There was a small thread of ""escape Bedlam"" that was just unbelievable and after pages and pages of nothing it was accomplished in a spur of the moment afterthought way.  From what I could gather the plot line consisted of absurd sex scenes (really? hours after meeting a filthy, epileptic crazy man she is ""tiddling"" on the floor of an insane asylum with him? really?) interspersed with, well, not much more.The hero was a sniveling, blushing ""genius"" with no real depth.  If he blushed or ""brushed away a tear"" again I might have had to break my kindle.  The heroine was a self-centered little sleaze.  Her first concern was always the crazy man she had just met, not her totally incoherent sister or anyone else who had been there for her through all of her troubles.The editing started out okay, for a cheap kindle book, but it was almost like by the end even the editor/proofreader was just skimming as the spelling and punctuation errors increased dramatically.The dialogue was unbelievable and almost painful to read.  The H & h's soliloquies of ""love and devotion"" were nauseating in the way they went on and on and on page after page all the way through.  We get it, they love each other like no one has ever loved before and will be there for each other forever and would give up their lives for the other.  There were times when a character would use a phrase or word that was just not true to the time but in the whole scheme of how bad this book was this was minor.I am still not sure what the heck happened in the ending.  I know there were tears and ""happily ever after"" with the promise of more to come---not for this reader though!--after a silly chase scene where it all ""came together"" and all made sense to everyone---not!The supporting characters were as inane and uninspiring as the mains---none were developed in a way that made them feel like real contributing parts of the story.There is so much more I could comment on that made this book bad, but I have already wasted too much time I will never get back on it.","09 8, 2012",A2SBNIQK0K5XDD,Lady ReadsaLot,So much bad,1347062400

Along the way, a group of feyquin (similar to horses) stop her in an effort to prevent her from going to the king.The best part of this book is that the author kept me guessing as to why she shouldn't go to Vastorn and who doesn't want her to get there.  There was another surprise that popped up that I didn't forsee, but I don't want to ruin the surprise.

It's haunted me ever since though since I never reviewed it once I did start blogging lol.The story centers around a nineteen year old girl named Selina whose only mission in life to heal with the special gift she was born with. However each healing she offers brings her closer to death, which is noted by the marking on her neck. Each time she heals the marking magically adds to itself until it encircles her neck and she dies.On this healing expedition she has to travel really far to heal the king of a neighboring kingdom. Despite being told not to go because the trek is dangerous, she knows she will die soon and it may be her only chance to have some adventure in her short life.She meets Faldon he's a shape shifter under a curse. He was once the leader of the Feyquin which are magical horses, the exact opposite of the well known Nitemares of many myths and lore. Faldon wants nothing more than to find the demon that cursed him and the human who shares his curse in the reverse fashion.He despises humans but something about Selina draws him to her and while they're friendship is rocky it's also strong.I found not one error in novella, so kudos to the editor!I absolutely loved this story. I without a doubt teared up at the end of it, my heart breaking for Faldon and Selina.I only wish this author had written a sequel so I could see what became of Faldon and the Feyquin, or even a prequel to learn more about Selina's life before this last trek.This is a great story and I think many people will love.I give this book 5 of 5 paws and apologize for the long delay in my review","09 8, 2013",A3I8GJ1I8MWIGS,S.Cu'Anam Policar,Amazing Novella,1378598400

5507,B002G1ZY4S,"[0, 0]",4,"There are two stories in the volume.  The twelve chapters of the first book are called stories but they are simply chapters.  In Bulldog Drummond  movies, Bulldog usually deals with mundane matters, a murder here and there, an evil uncle trying to cheat his lovely niece of her inheritance, etc. The stories in this book, set in the 1920s,  deal with a wide spread cadre of Bolsheviks and bomb throwing anarchists whose sole purpose is to destroy English society and the bourgeoisie.  They are led by an evil mastermind whose purpose is to seek profitable gain from the resulting chaos.Hugh Bulldog Drummond is a wealthy but bored decorated soldier  of the Great War.  He places an ad in the newspapers offering his services - ""Demobilised officer finding peace incredibly tedious, would welcome diversion. ... Excitement essential.""  Soon he is contacted by a beautiful young women who says she has accidentally stumbled upon a master criminal who has power over her father.  Bulldog decides to look into the matter and soon he is up to his neck in murder, Bolshevik plots and poison dart blowing pygmies.The stories are pure pulp fiction. The hero has no problem using his strength and skills (learned in the Great War) to kill evil doers.  Bulldog may fall into the clutches of the evil doers but they either let him go with a warning or he escapes wondrously.  Bulldog and some of his friends, who he enlists for the excitement, soon set things right.  The master evil ringleader, a man called Peterson,  reappears in the second story for more  of the same.The stories are a fun read with some of the language and vernacular of 1920s England.  Bulldog presents himself as a foppish, inane lay-a-bout to the world of decent society but he is a ruthless killer to the underworld.","09 10, 2013",A1YUY9VZKFUZDI,James Dainis,Fun 1920s Pulf Fiction,1378771200

5513,B002G1ZY4S,"[3, 4]",4,"These stories were described as ""pulp"", and I would never have guessed that I'd enjoy them, but I did!  Immensely!  All 4 stories in this collection take place in the mid-1920's and have a definite 'feel' to them that is characteristic of the era.  Most of the mysteries set in this time period in Britain tend to focus more on the lives of the (usually upper-class) characters and only secondarily on the mystery.  These books put the mystery front and center, and while Drummond is definitely upper-class in terms of being comfortably off financially and without a need for 'gainful' employment, he's not nobility and he doesn't hobnob with the landed gentry.  In our day and age, he'd be considered middle-class, and this gives the stories a sense of familiarity.There's a great deal of action, and violence - but it's fistfight and rough-and-tumble violence, not blood and guts like so many modern tales.  It's the violence of a refined, genteel world that still remembers the eye-opening shock of WWI as a salutatory lesson in man's inhumanity to man.IMO, the first 3 stories were much stronger and more likeable than the 4th, which is told in a different 'tone' and 'voice, but the tales themselves are very well done and interesting.  There's a common thread running between all 4 stories in this book, so they lead one to another.  All were excellent examples of the writer's art from the time period, and still have considerable appeal today.  Highly recommended!  There is also a volume 2  with 3 or 4 more books collected to show the further adventures of Bulldog (who I must say is an extremely likeable character!).Note on Kindle formatting:  Very good.  I couldn't find any issues with the first 3 books in this collection.  The 4th wasn't anywhere near as good - there were many OCR errors, which did slow down reading somewhat, though not to the point where the book was difficult to read.","07 1, 2011",A1Y62U4FMKFGZG,"Swim, Eat, Play",Mysteries that are about the mystery!,1309478400

5552,B002G9UFCQ,"[0, 0]",4,"This is an interesting story about the mystery surrounding who will inherit Castlegate Manor.  There is a scheming cousin with pockets to let, a mother trying to marry-off her daughter without losing their station, a daughter trying marry her love and avoid marriage to said icky cousin, a beautiful young woman masquerading as a lady but without the proper pedigree, and a protective groom that seems more than a mere servant.  All the characters play an integral part in discovering the secret and unraveling the mysteries of the Manor.  Even a dead great-aunt influences the action as the story unfolds.I like the chemistry between the Hero and heroine.  It is a chaste relationship but the sensual tension is there; you can sense these two are drawn to each other and are fighting to keep their hands to themselves.  I also like that the h is as nice as she is smart and truly regrets any subterfuge she feels compelled to enact.  She is pragmatic and realistic but yet still has dreams of 'what could be' in her life.  The H is terribly masculine and a leader from the outset in spite of his lowly position in the stables.  The reader can guess fairly early who the groom likely is but figuring out the penultimate mystery keeps one turning pages.  The villain is truly nasty so it's easy to root for his comeuppance and there is plenty of tension and suspense as the action resolves over the last chapters.Without giving anything away, I feel some readers will say it is pure fairytale how the author deals with the disparity between the classes in her story.  History records several instances of courtesans and actresses marrying into the peerage, but the circumstances in this book make overcoming societal constraints highly unlikely.  In this story the servant is known in London and the peer is not high-ranking enough to pull off ""ignoring what anyone may say,"" especially as the resolution of the mystery would lead to much speculation in the Ton and most likely publication in the papers.  There would be no way to hide who married whom and what rank they were prior to the marriage. As a firm believer in the concept of true love and the adage that love conquers all, however, I do see these two characters marrying anyway and weathering the storm, retiring happily to the country to live their private lives.  I say disregard the fantasy of the match and just smile over the hard-won HEA.This was a sneaky little charmer of a book.  The writing style was clean and concise and the author kept the pace moving steadily throughout the book.  The secret was not terribly hard to figure out, but it was still worth reading to the end to see how the story would play out.  This was a nice, clean, light read for a Sunday afternoon.","08 6, 2013",A217BVTGFAZBLT,Chick With Brains,sweet Regency mystery and romance with a touch of fairytale,1375747200

Matter of fact I'm over 21...well over 21...ran my batteries dead..NOW you know what batteries..I am broadening my reading tastes and buying anything Scottie Barrett writes. AN ABSOLUTE KEEPER (with a large supply of batteries).And for once the cover of that hunk matched the description. You guys can read it premise. What I loved is his portrayal and the FILET MIGNON in depth character study Scottie Barrett did. From the first, with 'Bechett baby' catchin a snooze in the hayloft after an early ""happy ending"" thats AFTER HE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT BACK HIS CASTLE'S meat for the week. At first he seemed like a wastrel. But he's the real deal. In modern times he would be a war hero. He's home from the crusades. He didn't think he would survive. The King suitably and righteously rewards him. He's in his early 30's. Very responsible and loving and enjoyin life. (HELL, I'M WELL OVER 21 AND I'D DO THE SAME THING)He earned it. It's his choice. And he takes it to the max.As I said I'm not doing story premise, but it's about 3 friends. 2 boys and 1 girl. Bechett baby is one of the boys, then his cousin (the other boy) and a girl.They were all raised together. He fell in love with the girl as children. Then life happens.

No matter what, I've enjoyed all of her stories, but the differentiator between I like her story and I love her story is definitely the length.  Both of her full length novels as part of this Karmic Consultants series are five stars.  This story is actually the first in the series and is not required to enjoy the others, but it provides a nice background and introduction to important characters.Lucy Cartwright is essentially a counselor for ghosts.  She helps them resolve their issues and to accept that they are dead so they can move on to the white light.  Unfortunately, you don't get to pick which ghosts come to you and since Lucy has been going through a dry spell romantically, she apparently is broadcasting her horniness to the dead.  This means that every horn dog ghost with unfulfilled sexual fantasies are visting Lucy with the hopes she'll be able to fulfill their cravings.  Of course it doesn't work that way and she can't even touch the ghosts, but she calls her boss Karma to see what she can do and Karma advises that she needs to get laid.The next day, Lucy is dragged out of bed by the pounding on her front door to find a strange, but hunky man on her doortstep and it's lust at first sight.  He introduces himself as Cox and tells her Karma sent him over so Lucy is mortified thinking Karma has sent her a gigolo to help her with her problem.  The thought of paying for sex is debilitating for only so long before she rationalizes she needs to get over her morals and succomb to temptation.  While she's entertaining fantasies in her head, the conversation gets a little awkward and it turns out that Cox is actually private investigator Jake Cox, Karma's brother, and he's there because Karma had a vision that a man who was recently murdered would be visiting her that evening.  Jake is investigating his murder and trying to track down evidence that will bring the murderer into custody.  Jake and Lucy have to wait it out together with the strain of their attraction since Lucy has to remain horny if she wants the ghost to show up.This story was fast paced with laugh out loud moments, but a whole lot less beleiveable, yes even with ghosts, than a full length novel where characters get a little more depth or there's more than your hookup within moments of meeting one another.  Although Lucy and Jake move on to be recurring characters in future books and actually a focal point for book 3, The Sexorcist, there really isn't much development of their relationship here beyond the physical.  Still, it's a light enjoyable escape and a great foundation for books 2 & 3.","05 17, 2011",A2KY76HK8DYRL3,A Book a Day,"Short, sexy, slapstick comedy",1305590400

Poor Lucy is a medium that has a lot of pent up sexual frustration, and until that gets resolved she will be visited by extremely horny ghosts.  Lucy's boss, Karma (isn't that adorable!) has called to let Lucy know that in order for these ghosts to go away, Lucy will need to be sexually satisfied.  Lo-and-behold, in comes PI Jake Cox!  He is quite the hunk and just what Lucy needs to get her fix.I loved the writing style in this novella, Andrews has a way with words that just made the entire story flow quickly and smoothly.

This is the sort of story that makes me hunker down and devour it whole.Lucy Cartwright is a Ghost Shrink who helps the newly dead work out their issues and transcend. Lately there's been a slew of horny ghosts showing up in her apartment at night, to hilarious effect. When her boss reveals that it's her own sexual frustration somehow calling out to the spirit realm, Lucy is mortified. When sexy Jake Cox shows up at her door, Lucy's libido responds in a pounce-first-ask-questions-later sort of way and she's even more mortified.I loved this story. The writing was fluid, the humor natural and effortless. You can't dismiss it as just a light and quirky sex romp either.

If you haven't experienced Ms. Andrew's writing...download this one, it is free right now at Amazon! It is a wonderful introduction to a superb writer.REVIEW: Lucy Cartwright is getting pretty aggravated. She is tired of being woken up at all hours of the night by sexually frustrated ghosts doing retch inducing strip teases for her. It doesn't make it any easier, either when she finds out it is probably her fault. Like attracts like, right? And a sexually frustrated medium will attract sexually frustrated ghosts.Her boss' solution? Get some. Easy for her to say and her jaw dropping hotness. Lucy is cute and domesticated, not big on inspiring lustful reactions in men. Lucy resigns herself to another night and another chubby accountant ghost - when a knock on her door brings her nose to nose with the sexiest man she has ever seen - and what she assumes is a gigolo that her boss sent over to relieve her frustration.Laugh out loud funny and sizzling sexiness is rampant in this novella. This is a must read...and why not give it a try while the amazon special is going on.This is short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for FREE here. I love a good book deal!RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, a lot of happy coupling. PNR fans and chick lit fans should enjoy.

I enjoyed that full length novel so much that I had to start from the beginning with the novella that started it all, and while I admit I enjoyedThe Ghost Exterminatorquite a bit more, The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo & The Poltergeist Accountant was cute and fun.Lucy Cartwright is a medium, but she's been sexually frustrated for so long that her energy is connecting the most prurient ghosts to her for help transcending, and frankly, she's getting a little fed up with short, balding, overweight accountant-type ghosts stripping down in her bedroom and bumping and grinding their way towards her bed. A call to her boss for help with the embarrassing situation ends with a suggestion that Lucy rid herself of her frustration to rid herself of the horny ghosts. To put it bluntly...and a bit crassly...she needs to get laid.Considering that the helpful, if difficult to take care of at the drop of a hat, suggestion came from her boss, it wasn't Lucy's fault that she assumed the tall, dark, and delicious-looking male who banged her...er...banged ON her door the next morning was an...employee bonus from the boss. He introduced himself as Cox, after all. Imagine her mortification, then, when she realizes that Jake Cox not only isn't a gigolo that her boss set up to help her out, he's a private investigator and the brother of said boss.Really, would becoming one of those horny ghosts be SO bad after she dies from embarrassment?Jake needs Lucy's special brand of help and Lucy needs special help, full stop. And they both want each other badly. Toss in a couple of horny, pathetic ghosts and a murder investigation and you have the fun, silly romp that is The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo & The Poltergeist Accountant.It's a light read, and it's told with Andrews' quick-witted and carefree style that goes down so easily. As a novella, it lacks in the depth of plot and character definition areas, though enough is provided for some fun. My only real problems with it were that it was a bit too light for me, almost slapstick, and Lucy and Jake's seismic-level attraction was a bit shallow for my tastes. There just wasn't enough time in the story, which even for a novella leans more towards the shorter end, to develop a relationship between them that was based on anything but physical attraction, so that didn't quite work for me.Still, this is a novella that isn't supposed to be taken too seriously, just enjoyed for what it is. It may not have been totally to my taste, butThe Ghost Exterminatordefinitely was, and I've already downloadedThe Sexorcist, which is the third book in the series and the second full-length novel. I will say, while I enjoyed seeing Lucy and Jake's introduction, as I'd met them inThe Ghost Exterminator, ultimately either of those stories could be read as stand-alones. 3.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","08 10, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""","Quick, Light, Fun, and Sexy",1281398400

Working on essays for grad school would have been more fun than reading this book, sadly.The only characters I really liked were Madame Medusala and the mom. The hero and heroine had very little to bring to the story and that is sad, because there was really a lot of potential.  The story felt contrived, the dialogue forced and unfunny.  I could tell the author was going for breezy, funny, romantic banter but it just didn't work, and neither did the sex scenes. I'm far from a prude, it wasn't the biting that made me not like them (referring to the warning in the product description), it was more that there was very little build up, it happened the same day the hero and heroine met.  The romantic/sexual tension that I prefer in books was simply lacking.  The hero and heroine were too easily manipulated by outside forces (her father and Max).I don't know how much this version of the book changed from the original, but this book should have been a short story or a novella instead of a novel.I got the book when it was free from amazon so I don't have buyer's remorse; I didn't hate the book but I would only recommend this with reservations.

5603,B002GEDE3I,"[3, 3]",5,"Holly North has agreed to something completely out of character.  As an accountant she would never strut about looking like an `X-rated Mrs. Claus, but with a little pleading and begging from her friend that's exactly what she's going to do.  Due to the illness that has been sweeping through Sugar Plums, a Christmas-themed strip club, Holly dons the Mistress Christmas getup - adds a velvet mask and struts her stuff for the crowd.Detective Nick West is on a mission.  Granted it's entirely off the clock since his friend didn't want to file a report about the supposed robbery that occurred at Sugar Plums.  He's dead set on taking down the thieving Mistress Christmas - until he gets a good look at her.  Now he's far more interested in uncovering all her secrets on a personal level than pursuing her in any legal manner.For Holly the freedom allotted along with anonymity is a real eye opener.  Especially once she meets Nick who promises that he's definitely more sinner than saint.  He's the epitome of all her sexual fantasies rolled into one tight, hot package that she would love to find under her Christmas tree tied neatly with a bow.  Reality is that as an accountant he would probably never give her a second look but she's incognito and as Mistress Christmas she's allowed to be more bold and daring than she'd normally dare.  Their first meeting is full of sexual innuendoes and Christmassy humor but it's the lap dance he insists on that really turns up the heat.  Nick is a little confused since as a seasoned stripper Holly should know the rules about touching or kissing during the session.  Instinctively he knows that Holly is innocent of wrongdoing but as a seasoned detective it's hard to let go of his concerns.When Holly confides her naughty Christmas wish well, Nick's certainly not going to disappoint her - especially when her wish is one night of sexual decadence ... with him!  Neither of them knows the truth about the other.  He believes her to be a stripper who may or may not be robbing the men she dances for and all she knows about him is he's a Wyoming cowboy who does lots and lots of paperwork in his current occupation.  Their deceptions may prove to be problematic in the future but for this one night, they're going to do far more than get tangled up in the tinsel.Lorelei James is certain to bring a smile to your face with this holiday inspired tale.  MISTRESS CHRISTMAS is full of smart and sassy characters, sexually charged situations, a little suspense, and plenty of chuckles.  Holly and Nick complement each other beautifully and I got a huge kick out of being privy to their relationship as it developed.  The whole time I was reading I wondered how Nick's `investigation' would turn out and I have to tell you it was nothing like I expected.  Ms. James certainly throws readers a curveball on that one.  This is a wonderful story and well worth adding to your keeper shelves.MISTRESS CHRISTMAS is the first story in a brand new series entitled the WILD WEST BOYS.  While I can't find anything about future releases in this series I'll definitely be on the lookout for them.  Will also be going back and reading the ROUGH RIDERS books since I discovered this series is loosely connected to them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","11 30, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

Holly has a normal boring job as an accountant but her best friend convinces her to fill in as Mistress Christmas. So this shy sexy account slowly burst out of her shell with a couple courage shots and embraces a wild side.Detective Nick West is at the club hoping to catch Mistress Christmas in the act...of stealing from her male customers. One look at Holly aka Mistress Christmas and he is hooked. He soon gets a lap dance he won't soon forget and just knows that he is far from done with Holly.Personally I prefer the authors other series spotlighting on the McKays but this was a great break from them and it was nice to read about a West boy. The Wests boys are cousins to the wild McKay bunch. It even made reference back to a couple of the McKay boys so if you've read the Rough Rider Series you'll enjoy that.This was actually an ebook from my local library that I got from an Amazon loan..so can't beat that.

This story is based in Denver, and the couple focus is on Nick West and Holly North.My TakeThis is about the West branch of the McKay family and fits in about where Cam has been back from Iraq for ten months, four months in Sundance; Colt has been sober two years now and moving out of the Boar&#8217;s Nest. Cam bought him and Buck out.It's cute enough, too cute really---it does make a sweet Christmas tale. And I was impressed that the shy Holly North should come out with that comment about how &#34;not all women mount up the same or crave that type of wild ride&#34;. It didn&#8217;t fit with the persona I was imagining, and it made me start to wonder just how wild &#34;Mistress Christmas&#34; could get.Both are hiding who they really are even though they&#8217;re telling the truth. And ain&#8217;t that a twist? It was fun, but it didn&#8217;t make it ring quite true---not enough of a twist. The story tried, it definitely tried but it was too cute and too pat. A little too Cinderella-ish.For such a shy woman, Holly certainly lost any shyness by the time she fell into bed with Not-So-Saint-Nick.It was cute how in tune they were about their feelings about the Christmas season.The StoryNick has a strong sense of honor and when his friend gets rolled by a stripper named Mistress Christmas. Only the real Mistress Christmas is out sick, and Holly is filling in to help out her friend.It&#8217;s a chance to get wild and Nick is more than willing to help her out.The CharactersHolly North is an accountant with a soft spot for a friend. And a secret urge to find out what it would be like to be wild. She has one sister, Crystal, and a brother, Tim, having kids. Ivy Lane is a friend and a client who runs a gentlemen&#8217;s club, Sugar Plums.Detective Nick West is a cop in Denver but most of his family still resides in Wyoming where his brother Blake and his dad raise sheep.

But, she has for some reason decided to go along with it, probably since she can't seem to say no to a friend in need, as long as she wears a mask.  She is surprised at how wicked it all makes her feel, and how she can let her lusty inner devil out.Detective Nick West is at the club, on his own time, trying to get Mistress Christmas to try and rob him, as his close friend claims happened to him.  He can't believe that the leggy brunette with the smoky eyes is the one responsible for the deeds his friend claims.  But she definitely gets his blood running at a fever pitch.Their attraction is mutual and when Holly blurts out her Christmas wish on the second night they meet he is only too happy to grant it.  The thing is one night might not be enough for either, can Holly reveal her real self to Nick? Will they both take a chance on love?But, with one misunderstanding it all might be lost.Mistress Christmas is a fantastic addition to the Wild West Boys.  This one from the West side of the family and in a big city no less.  I loved how Nick is thrown into falling for a woman he thinks there is no way he can have.

From the title and the synopsis, I was concerned that the leading lady would be a dominatrix, something I'm not into reading about.  Boy, I was totally wrong.Holly North fills in for a friend at a holiday themed strip club, no stripping, just walking around and talking to patrons while in the Mistress Christmas costume.  Detective Nick West is at the strip club, running his own off-duty undercover operation.  He immediately connects with Holly, and they arrange to share a night of passion.  Nick lives up to any expectation you may have about the McKay/West men as lovers, managing to be passionate, tender, and dominant, all in one night.  Holly turns out to be a bit inexperienced, and Nick is very tender and patient with her all night, it was so charming.  Of course there is a conflict that must be resolved at the end.  I really loved the relationship between the two of them.This is an excellent read, and I recommend it whether or not you are familiar with the other novels by Ms. James.  The McKay/West family is barely mentioned, so it can be a standalone story.  It is a very quick ebook, a couple hours tops.  If you would like it in print format, the bookWild West Boyscontains this story, and a story about Nick's brother called Miss Firecracker.

Don't let the first few pages put you off- it actually gets even better.This was a very quick read, and was a fascinating mixed bag for me, but one I enjoyed. I will admit to finding the speed at which the lust blossoms to be off-putting. It felt almost like cheap sex at first, but events that occurred midway into the story provide the necessary distance and depth.The characters ended up being very well developed. As another reviewer mentioned, the opening chapter can give the impression that this will be just another silly vamp romance with no substance. While it certainly isn't DEEP, the characters are well rounded.(As an aside, Ms. Byrne absolutely NAILED a psychologically abusive relationship that gave our heroine some issues to work through. It was so well captured, it gave me shivers.)The mythology is pretty standard vampire stuff- nothing fancy. The paranormal side of this story is relatively low key, but well utilized. The vampirism makes for some highly erotic moments and adds just a little spice to the romance. There isn't a lot of magic or mystery, though.The only other issue I really had with this story is the ending. It just ends. WHAM. Over- lights out, no reading under the covers. It felt a little like someone shut off the TV before that final scene of the show where you get that final sense of closure and all ends are tied off. It is abrupt and doesn't feel quite complete.In the end, I look forward to reading more in this series. This one, especially with that ending, felt like a tease, just a taste of things to come. It will be fun to see not just more characters in this world Ms. Byrne has created, but also how her writing continues to grow. She has a very natural style that lends itself to well developed characters. Hopefully she will give them a little more time and room in her upcoming stories.ADDITIONAL READS: More light vampire centric romance...Marta Acosta'sHappy Hour at Casa DraculaR.G.

Alex's mother and father still adhere to the Old Ways, including the absolute belief in dream premonitions of their son's future wives. Alex is the first Faustian to be fated with a wife . . . the only thing is she lives in Colorado and will take a little convincing (of Alex's love for her, their bond and the truth about vampires).It's true; there are some bad vampire love stories out there. But Evie Byrne's first book in the `Faustin Brothers' trilogy isn't one of them. To be honest, `Called by Blood' isn't reinventing the fang - there's a mortal love interest, a rich and powerful vampiric family and a lot of smexing going on. But Byrne's series is oddly delightful, regardless of the well-trod territory.One of the great things about this book is Byrne's tongue-in-cheek humour. Alex Faustin lives in modern-day New York and his `mate' is Helena, a modern woman. These people know about vampires - the movies, myths and romantic ridiculousness - and as a result, Byrne draws on many references and pokes fun at many a legend. I liked her vampiric brevity - it was refreshing, without denouncing all the typical vampire/mortal problems.This novel is very sexy, first and foremost. It's from Samhain Publishing - a notoriously hot publisher. But `Called by Blood' has a surprisingly veering plot; when the rich and handsome Alex is burnt by the sun and spends a portion of the book resembling Freddy Krueger. That's right, a vampire love story in which the smoking-hot dead dude looks nasty and blistered for much of the book. It means that Alex and Helena have to connect on a personal level before a physical one . . . but when they do get physical, Byrne brings the goods (while still keeping things light and funny).My one small complaint about the book was the abrupt ending - I really would have liked another 100 pages or so. Since this is the `Faustin Brothers' trilogy it would have been nice to meet all of the Faustin brothers and get a sense of the family dynamic (as it is, we only meet oldest brother, Mikhail). And with an extra 100 pages we may have been able to read about Helena assimilating to vampirism and New York. But that's a small and complimentary complaint about wanting more, more, more from Evie Byrne's wonderful novel!","02 26, 2011",A33C08C20U6DJ0,"Dee18 ""dee""",Funny fangtastic!,1298678400

When a horrible incident reveals his secret, Helena learns he is a creature of darkness.How will she reconcile her feelings for a man who is monster?Admittedly, I had mixed feelings about Called by Blood.  I was not sure if I liked Helena and Alex because they sometimes came off as immature in their reactions and interactions to various situations they were forced to overcome and deal with.  It's been noted that love often makes people reckless.  Perhaps it was Helena's emotional baggage and Alex's spoiled haphazard bungling that that kept me off kilter.  I'm not certain.  All I know is that I really became interested in some of the secondary characters that appeared.  *Shrug* It happens sometimes.The writing style was very contemporary which mostly didn't work for me in the narrative along with the large doses of saccharine romance.  Also, the sweetness seemed at odds with the down and dirty sex.  Overall, it was a pretty decent novel, with harrowing moments and plot twists that kept me reading.  The best compliment I can offer is that I'm willing to reread this story again.  There are a lot of things about it to like and in all fairness, I've been reading lots of vampire fiction back to back, so my expectations differ from book to book.  I'm rather biased against treating vampires in the traditional manner and really get into books where vampirism `evolves' beyond the usual limitations.  This may have colored my initial response to Alex and the hardships he faces with Helena.  Still, I'm also the first to admit that it was used constructively as an effective plot device, and that's worth a bright gold star instead of a wooden stake.Patrice F.","02 3, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Called by Blood,1265155200

However, she fully admits that she enjoys having a man in her bed and it's been too long since she's indulged in some down and dirty sexcapades.School's out for winter break and Caitlin's determined to have a good time before returning to her normal life of responsibility and control.  The last thing she expects is to run into a blast from the past called Eamon Blake, an Irishman with whom she'd shared a hot summer fling while staying in Ireland working at his family's pub.  They'd been great friends with benefits back then and Caitlin has no qualms about reawakening that side of their relationship.Eamon made the move from Ireland to establish a photography business in Las Angeles after the death of his father.  He's in Seattle where he has a few shoots to do for clients but running into Caitlin is a huge unexpected bonus.  He'd had a great time with Caitlin in Ireland and he's more than interested in reestablishing the sexual side of their relationship.  What he doesn't expect is the sudden desire for their relationship to be more than casual despite the fact that he isn't ready to settle down.Eamon's only going to be in Seattle for a week so they agree to enjoy the time they're together and part as friends.  Only neither of them is able to let go and via phone calls and occasional visits they continue their affair long distance.  At some point the long distance affair isn't going to cut it any longer.  Will their relationship survive an ultimatum or will they both find themselves alone and heartbroken over what may have been?Lauren Dane books have become a staple in my reading library.

It's the typical guy/girl with chemistry that really like one another but neither wants to be in a relationship.

She did this rather well in this story as well.  I also like how strong her female characters usually are.  There is one thing that annoyed me.  After the h asks the H to make a bigger comittment the H pretty much freaks and bails on her, in Mexico no less.  After a month she tries to reconnect with him as friends and he blows her off again.  Even though this guy was not a complete jerk it really annoyed me that he strolls in on her and declares that he has changed his mind taking for granted that she would drop everything and have him back, this is after months apart and him telling her that he had gone out on a date.  She of course is so happy she takes him back without a single doubt.  GRRR!!!  I love this author but it really annoys me when writers take a strong female character and resolve the story by just having her forgive and forget so easily.  Especially when the h was such a strong character.  Even though the H concedes to her in the end it was still really annoying that she did not even utter any hesitation.

On closer introspection she's afraid that he's planning on dumping her without having to say anything.  It wouldn't be the first time she was rejected in such a callous way.Mark Rodriquez has treated his relationship with Jodi as a casual situation.  They'd agreed that their relationship wouldn't be long term but breaking things off with her definitely isn't his intention.  Mark has an ulterior motive behind his instance that Jodi infiltrate the estate today but once his plans come to light he realizes that he might have made a huge mistake.  His feelings for Jodi are much stronger than he was willing to admit.Jodi's not at all worried about infiltrating the estate and cracking the safe.  She's very talented at what she does - and it's not like she's actually a criminal.  The whole thing is a set up to test the estate's security - or at least that's what she's been lead to believe.  Of course, Mark's complicated the whole thing a bit by introducing an adult toy into the equation.  Everything goes according to plan and she breaks into the safe in less than two minutes - just like she bet Mark she could - and then she gets busted.It seems Mark didn't forget her birthday after all.  He arranged for his friend Sam to catch Jodi at a critical moment and she's flabbergasted that such a thing could happen.  She makes the decision to level with her captor and give him the note that she was supposed to leave in the vault - only the note isn't what she believes it to be. It's the list of sexual fantasies that she'd written out for Mark and he's enlisted Sam's help to cross some of her fantasies off that list - and he'll definitely need help with number six, ""I'd like to have a m&eacute;nage with Mark and another man that we can trust.""Just when Jodi gets into the spirit of her birthday gift, Mark realizes that sharing HIS woman isn't something he really wants to do.  That's when Sam steps up and changes the rules just a bit.  Will Mark and Sam come out of this interlude on friendly terms and what about Mark and Jodi's romance? Will he still want her as his lover, or has that changed?Leah Braemel's PRIVATE PROPERTY delves into all of one woman's naughty fantasies and promises to leave readers hot and sweaty.

It is also Leah's first published work and I enjoyed it so much I knew I'd read anything future she published. The characters are interesting, the dialog engaging, and the sex scenes are hot. What truly enamored me though was the fact that this book takes place less than a half of a mile from my home and she described it perfectly.This book centers around Mark Rodgriguez and Jodi Tyler. Mark is the owner of Celeda Security located in Texas and Jodi one of his operatives. The book opens with Jodi staking out a home she is suppose to break into to prove to the owner that his current security company isn't any good and they should hire Mark's company. Jodi is upset that Mark chose her to head up this security breach since it's her birthday and she'd rather spend the evening with him. She begins to think that perhaps this is Mark's way of breaking off their ""no strings"" relationship. What we soon find out is that Mark has set up an evening with his old college roommate and friend, Sam Watson, (owner of Hauberk Security) to help him fulfill some of Jodi's fantasies as a birthday gift. The tables are turned on Mark and he soon realizes that he has been an idiot when it comes to Jodi.This is a very good book, Mark is a likeable albeit at times kind of clueless hero. He thinks he has his relationship with Jodi all figured out but in reality he doesn't. It takes Sam, some restraints, and some interesting situations to make him see things differently.Jodi is capable, extremely likeable, but very insecure. She's dated some losers in the past that have made it difficult to trust and thus she's always waiting for Mark to dump her. She's feeling guilty because she agreed to an unemotional affair with Mark but she's fallen in love with him.I like both Mark and Jodi, but Sam is the one that stole the show in this book. From the minute he came on the scene I was hooked and knew that I had to know more about this complex man. Considering all the ""fun"" things he has in his home, you just know there is a great story behind him.For a first book, Private Property is very good but it left me wanting more. While the story is complete, I knew that I'd have to read the next one as soon as it was available. I always love when I find a writer that I ""mesh"" with right away and Leah is one of those authors.

He has enlisted the help of Sam to give her the experience of a lifetime and to fulfill her fantasy list.  When the time comes to put the plan in action, he is shocked by his own reaction to Sam pleasuring Jodi.Jodi never expected to have her wildest fantasies played out before her eyes with two smoking hot guys.  She wants to experience everything they are offering but at the same time she doesn't want to alienate Mark.  She is excited about the opportunity before her but apprehensive at the same time.She is in love with Mark but because of her bad history with guys she thinks Mark is getting ready to break up with her.  He blew her off on her birthday and scheduled her to work, why else would he do this unless he was tired of her.Sam is glad to join in on their fun but one look at Mark with Jodi and he knows he's a third wheel.  He cares about his friend and is determined to make his friend admit what is in his heart, even if he hates him when he is done.  Jodi is beautiful and responsive to his every touch and he just wants Mark to realize the treasure he has.Mark isn't into long term relationships until Jodi.  She is smart and beautiful and he doesn't want to share her, even if it's to fulfill her fantasies.  He's angry at Sam because he has to sit and watch their play without participating.  He is also extremely turned on watching Sam dominate her but he has an overwhelming urge to mark her as his.This story was hot, sexy and a lot of fun.  Mark was super sweet to arrange for Jodi's fantasies to be played out, even if he wasn't crazy about another man touching her.  The dominate scene with Sam was powerful but I think the scene afterward with just the two of them was even more powerful.The characters were kept to a minimum which worked for this story.  There was also enough back story for the reader to understand what was going on, without over powering them with too much information.

He seemed very beefy and the way he acted so protective of Jodi was just weird. He just met her. It was odd that he was ""if you ever hurt I'll hurt you"" attitude.

This story was full of lust, passion and sexual tension, it took up good two thirds of the book! There was a plot of course but you pretty much got to the point 80 percent in. There was so much sizzling hot tension going on I couldn't help but blush - and I read my fair share of erotic romance but this, whoa boy! talk about a Hot read!The story begins with Mark cooking up a birthday present for his girlfriend with whom he has a sort of loose relationship, he thinks nothing of sharing her with his college roommate/best friend, but when he sees Sam touching Jodi something possessive gets hold of him and before you can say gotcha, he's jealous. This story is mainly about Mark coming to realize he loves Jodi and wants to spend the rest of his life with her - but boy all the s*x and the for*play in this novel... it's seriously hot enough to melt your e-reader!I like the set up for Sam's story, Personal Protection, which I imagine will be even kinkier with his erm... sexual preference and high tech toys.If you are looking for a believable romance this isn't for you but if you like to indulge a little on a fantasy then pick this up, its one hot ride!But like all erotic romance a Happily Ever After is a requirement, and this one had it, which made all the frustration and jealousy worth reading through - who am I kidding I read this in two hours flat! ;)","03 12, 2012",A6HYUCFV2SUNW,Niina &#34;For The Love of Reading!&#34;,"Whoa, boy!",1331510400

He insisted she'd handle this particular case of breaking and entering to prove to the owner that they were the better security company. All goes well until Jodi gets caught and cuffed between two men.That's the smattering of plot, and pretty much the extent of my enjoyment of the novella. It had its moments but deflated pretty quickly. There wasn't really any foreplay-you know, the part that's supposed to turn people on-and only the setting itself was intriguing.Had the author chosen an honest roleplay option I would have enjoyed the erotica part more, but Braemel chose to underline Jodi's insecurities and all the things that made her an unlikeable character to me. The author also chose to wrote lengthy explanations on why would a normal, usually a quite vanilla, woman acquiesce to participate in a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with her boyfriend and a man she'd never met before. I'm assuming this was done to lure in the threesome newbie readers, and I'm assuming the pandering in the end was written for them too.For me, it didn't work. The sex got boring after the first nipple sucking and the attempt to add plot and justification for a couple taking a one night lover pretty much ruined any and all respect I had left for the characters. Any of them. It's safe to say that without heavy-handed recommendations from my friends, I won't be reading more of Leah Braemel's work.","04 16, 2012",A28CZRO0PHRYQA,rameau,Criminally boring for an erotica.,1334534400

In between assignments they live in a remote cabin waiting for the next call, during the time they stay there they see a cougar, one theyve come to call their pet.Kaya, Hunter and Jericho create a romance that is unique, when the men leave on a call its supposed to be only for a few weeks at the most, but things go wrong and the men get hurt leaving a pregnant Kaya to defend for herself thinking she was abandoned.My Opinion: The story was touching to read and well written, surprisingly the 3way relationship wasnt an issue it was just another part to the story.","03 24, 2010",A38YS1DNHC3CVC,"Ashlyn ""ash""",Shape-Shifter romance,1269388800

Neither would have guessed that they'd find a new reason to make their Rocky Mountain cabin a home courtesy of a beautiful creature who captures their attention.Kaya, a cougar shifter, has lived with very little human interaction but something draws her to Hunter and Jericho's cabin.  At first she only watches the men from a distance and enjoys their scent but injured and in need of a place to rest, she makes the decision to trust them and enters their home.  Despite her attraction to the men, Kaya isn't ready to trust them with her secret - but she's unable to resist the idea of a cooked meal and shifts once she believes the men are asleep for the night.Hunter and Jericho are confused about the young woman's appearance in their cabin.  What's she doing there wearing only Jericho's discarded shirt?  From her reaction to being discovered inhaling food it's obvious she's terrified and that only increases their curiosity about her.  When she bolts from the house they pursue her and bring her back - after all they can't leave a naked woman alone in the snow-covered mountains.Both men are attracted to Kaya and protecting her is a priority.  They've never encountered anyone like her before but aren't exactly ready to share another woman either.  How are they going to handle learning about her shifter abilities or the isolated life she's led?  There's a world of difference between them.  Can it be overcome?  And what happens when Hunter and Jericho get called out on an assignment and must leave Kaya behind?Maya Banks delivers yet another captivatingly emotional read that promises to stay in your memory long after you've finished reading the final page of AMBER EYES.  Hunter, Jericho and Kaya have deep-seated fears and issues which have dictated how they handle situations.  Trust doesn't come easy for any of them but with a lot of patience, understanding and love they all have the possibility of finding happiness together.  AMBER EYES is one of those stories that draws the reader into the plot, allows you to fall in love with the characters and warms your heart with each new revelation.  I smiled, worried, laughed, agonized and cried along with the characters and wanted nothing more than for them to all have a happily-ever-after.

She's been watching Jericho and Hunter, two men who live in an isolated cabin, and they have been watching her. When she is hurt, she allows them to help her--and they discover that their wild cougar companion is in fact a beautiful woman. They both form an attachment to her, and are reluctant to leave her even when their work calls them away.I liked that the plot was slow and mellow. It has a quiet, isolated feel that I found relaxing. It isn't an adventure story, and the paranormal element is uncomplicated and matter-of-fact. That simplicity really fit the story and set the tone.While reading this story, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how the author intended to characterize each of her protagonists. Kaya comes across as a bit weak and helpless, but then you have to bare in mind that she hasn't had much human contact. Still, I feel like the author could have spent a little time establishing that Kaya does have some innate strength, and isn't totally dependent on her men to provide for her. Hunter is portrayed as the more closed off, emotionally isolated of the two men. Why that is is never fully explained. I can't really get a handle on Jericho's personality at all, other than that he's a bit more open than Hunter. Both men are, of course, insanely protective and intent on caring for Kaya. I think part of the problem at work here is page limitation. It's a short book, so there is only a limited amount of time to establish everyone's personality and allow them to develop.My other ""complaint"" is the sunny, slightly sugar coated ending. Everyone is accepting of Kaya and her relationship with two men. Nobody comments or thinks it's odd. Everybody is just part of a big happy family. That's a bit unrealistic. But then, this book has shape-shifting so I guess I shouldn't demand realism.All told, for a novella you can read in one day, this is worthwhile. It has steam, emotion, and a fairly satisfying happy ending. 3.5 stars.","08 29, 2011",A2CCQ83OH7WGAE,Chelsea Marie Spencer,A Cougar and Two Mates,1314576000

5715,B002GYVWAK,"[9, 9]",4,"Of all the Jules Verne ebook compilations containing 30+ titles currently available in the Kindle store, this Halcyon Press edition is pretty good. An active TOC pinpoints specific content. I am particularly happy to see a full and modern translation of ""20,000 Leagues"" by F.P.Walter (though he is not credited and his informative, introductory essay is not included). I'm also glad to see a true (""Professor Lidenbrock"") translation of ""Journey to the Interior of the Earth"" rather than the sadly all-too-common bogus (""Professor Hardwigg"") version often passed off as being by Verne. The other major works are translated reasonably well keeping in mind that these are older, public domain versions. I do, however, prefer a slightly different public domain version of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Dick Sand,"" but that's a mere quibble.I have two more quibbles. FIRST is that several times a graphic will not be included but the words ""graphic appears here"" will appear instead. SECOND is that italics are often represented by an underline before and after the emphasized word(s), __like this___, a confusing annoyance when the names of several ships (normally italicized) are being referred to. These are not deal-breakers but something you may wish to consider (and because of them I have subtracted one star). The formatting is otherwise okay.As to containing 36 works, the count is inflated a tad by counting the two parts of ""Captain Hatteras"" as separate entities and unnecessarily including (and counting) a duplicate portion of ""Mysterious Island.""  You really get 34 distinct tales (not 36)--but that is still a lot of Verne, though it is by no means complete. That honor goes to Delphi.Delphi has a truly complete set, though a dozen works (not yet cheaply available in public domain translations) appear in French for the sake of completeness. Since I am not fluent in that language, I do not fully appreciate their inclusion. I do, however, greatly appreciate the inclusion of about 20 (!) more titles--in English--than this Halcyon (or any other) set. This makes the Delphi edition the largest and most appealing to me (even though the aforementioned modern translation by F.P. Walter is not used in it).I would encourage you to search, sample, and compare because new Verne collections keep popping up all the time in the Kindle Store. Check to see which titles are included, if the main TOC is active and takes you to additional active TOCs (one for each book), and that the text is formatted to your liking. See if graphics and illustrations are included. The one you ultimately select will depend upon the level of your interest in, and the degree of your enthusiasm for, the writings of Jules Verne. If you want a substantial collection which includes the well-known great Verne classics, this Halcyon set (or a recent, $.99 one from e-artnow, which is worth examining) should be quite fine. But if you want even MORE (as in EVERYTHING), the very BEST is that all-inclusive Delphi set.","02 14, 2012",A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,Librarian,"Very good, but not best, Verne collection.",1329177600

Chase, but well, sometime it's good to forget that there are places in this world where you can't really be who you are without worrying of the consequences, and it's important to tell the story as you would like it to be, since maybe, time over time, you will change a mind at time.And so in this story we have Tyler and J.T., twin rodeo cowboys. Both handsome and gay (well actually, J.T. is bisexual...), J.T. is the shiny twin, while Tyler is the shy one. Tyler is also the responsible one, first his mother on her death bed and then his father asked him to take care of his twin, and Tyler always acted as guardian angel. He also left his beloved ranch, and his beloved neighbor Ren, to follow his twin on the rodeo circuit. But eight years after, Tyler is wondering if it's not time to come back at home, J.T. or not J.T. on tow.At home there is not only is aging father, but also Ren, the older and handsome neighbor who was Tyler's unrequited first love. Tyler has never had the courage to confess to Ren his feelings, instead he talked to J.T. who, soon after, seduced Ren. Now Tyler doesn't know if being happy to have a proof that Ren is gay, or be unhappy to be forced once again to compete with his twin.On the other hand, Ren is only waiting for Tyler to be old enough, and tired enough of the outside world, to be ready to settle down in their ranches. Ren is the older brother of three, but his two brothers have no intention to stay at the ranch. So Ren is ready and willing to build a family, and Tyler was always is first choice when arriving to a life partner. His relationship with J.T. was only a fling, and something that tired him soon after the first encounter.Ren has some personality issues, a legacy from his military service during war time, and he needs to be in control in every moment. On the other hand, Tyler needs to let the control sometime, since he is always the reliable twin, the one who everyone expected to take the right decision. In this way, Ren and Tyler are perfect together, being Ren always the top in their relationship, and Tyler the willing bottom.So no problem in their relationship and no problem also outside their relationship: Tyler's father behaves like a old fashioned father, means that he only asks Ren's intentions toward his son, and he is more than happy when he is assured that they are honest; Ren's brothers are only waiting for their brother to find a partner in order to be able to move out of the ranch without worrying to leave their brother alone... Sure, there is no the time, or the chance, to see the behavior of who is not a strict relative, other than one of Tyler's friend, but the atmosphere of all the book is of a total acceptance of Ren and Tyler's love.Setting and details are very accurate, with few right positioned words, T.A. Chase gives the reader all the necessary details to be deeply immerse in the rodeo and breeding horse culture.","05 27, 2013",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Bound by Love by T.A. Chase,1369612800
5733,B002HE1GS2,"[6, 6]",5,"When I first started reading M/M, I purposely avoided ""cowboy romances"" because they seemed clich&eacute;.  However, I am quickly finding they can be quite good and my opinion has changed.  I love the Cattle Valley series by Carol Lynne, so when I saw this novella from TA Chase (who I have read and enjoyed before) I went for it.The story is a fairly straightforward romance.  Tyler and JT are twins, and Tyler has always been the follower, taking care of JT on the rodeo circuit.  Until he finally decides he needs a life of his own, possibly with the handsome horse breeder Ren, that he can't get out of his heart.  There is angst in the story (JT having slept with said horse breeder simply b/c Tyler wanted him!) but it is nothing heartrending and easily overcome by the couple - as it should be in a novella that doesn't have the time or scope to expand.  The sex (I know you romance junkies are wondering) was excellent, better than I find in most short stories/novellas.  Chase throws a bit of kink into the mix, so it's not vanilla, but it is also far from BDSM.  A little bondage and some spanking heat the sex up very satisfyingly without tipping into uncomfortable.  I could easily reread this story again.A couple things did annoy me, such as Tyler constantly referring to Ren as ""the older man"" and the somewhat abrupt ending.  There was the requisite HEA, but a couple more paragraphs would have ended it more smoothly. Overall though, it was a very good story and I actually hope there'll be a sequel with JT.","07 29, 2009",ACEA95FQS1AVP,Jem,"A good, satisfying cowboy romance",1248825600

There are a lot of wonderful ideas in this story and I think they deserved more space to develop because some of the situations, especially those on the dream plane, faded to black and then came back too abruptly. Instead of the confusion of the main character, I was left only with a sense of disorientation.The setting was really fantastic. The story takes place on a train and the other protagonist is a mysterious man, part magician, part healer. Marco Satori is a very interesting character and he makes you hold your breath when he appears on the page. And he's very sexy.Edwin, from whose point of view we see the story, is melancholic and in need of salvation and Marco gives him awareness and also a spark of will to change the situation he is in.There is a paranormal twist, and it was a big thing, with a lot of information that made me crave for a longer story.

With a history of spells of black despair, Edwin can't be sure if his attraction to the strange magician is real or not...Sleight of Hand is an odd and hot paranormal tale in which things are not as they seem.  Katrina Strauss did an excellent job of evoking an atmosphere that was mysterious, and even a little spooky.  I couldn't always determine what was reality and what wasn't right away, which kept me reading to find out.  It was easy to sympathize with fragile, earnest Edwin.  Satori was a bit harder to get a handle on.  His motives were murky and although he clearly wanted Edwin, I wasn't sure I bought that he loved him.  There's a big twist at the end that sort of explains Satori's behavior, and quite a few other things.  Overall, Sleight of Hand's hot, kind of creepy vibe held my interest, and I enjoyed the story.

Nikki believes that there is just something wrong with anyone who would submit to games or allow someone to control them sexually.  However, as emotions get crazier, Nikki wonders if Adam just might be right and if he is the one person she can trust to give up control to.Reaction Time is all about control--having it and getting it.  Nikki has had to be the leader in her family, her race team and her love life.  Right now, only her race team is at the top of its game.  One out of three is not good odds.

They shared one sexual encounter eight years ago that was less than satisfying but that hasn't stopped her from obsessing over him.  Somehow she just knows that they could be so good together - if Gabriel would just unleash the beast lurking beneath his nice guy exterior.Gabriel Bettencourt likes sex rough and hard and he's positive that Charity is too sweet to be able to handle his needs.  It was holding back that had caused that night eight years ago to be so unsatisfactory.  She's exactly the sort of woman he'd want if it wasn't for the little issue of his sexual tastes.  He's in for quite a surprise because Charity isn't going to continue to allow him to pretend indifference where she's concerned.With Christmas just around the corner Charity's pulling out all the stops and going after the man she's been in love with for longer than she cares to remember.  From an early age their mother's had them paired up together and with so much in common - their Portuguese heritage and sense of family values being a big plus - they do make the perfect couple.  Everyone around them recognizes their attraction to each other and their playful innuendos aren't kidding anyone.  With the aid of a little red sweater and a little too much Jose Cuervo she confronts Gabriel and even though he doesn't admit to his true feeling for her the kiss they share after he drives her home leaves no doubt that she gets to him.  Of course he pulls the gentlemanly act and leaves her sexually frustrated because he's not going to take advantage of an intoxicated woman.  Good thing Charity doesn't give up easily and she's got a fiery temper that will serve her well while dealing with Gabriel and his convoluted thinking where she's concerned.Lauren Dane does it again.  SWEET CHARITY encompasses everything I've come to love in Ms. Dane's novels.  The characters are down to earth, loveable, and absolutely delightful to get to know.  Charity's ballsy confrontations with Gabriel left me snickering and a little in awe of her bravado.  Gabriel's protective instincts and preference for BDSM loving left me drooling.  One of the things I loved about this story is how much the characters treasure their families and their heritage.  Add how perfect Charity and Gabriel are for each other without even realizing it really warms the heart.  Of course, Charity's fiery temper had me laughing out loud because sweet she definitely isn't once riled.

Deciding she is no longer going to take his indifference, Charity lures him back into her bed only to be told afterwards by Gabriel that their relationship can go no further.

Carson has always been known to be wild and a playboy, never having relationships except one night stands.  During his best friend's bachelor party, he was starting to feel nostalgic and began to think about his own life and how perhaps it was time to tame his wild ways and settle down.  While talking to his friend, a beautiful brunette comes over and asks him and his friends to take her dancing.  He jumps at the opportunity to dance with Holly. During their dance, the attraction is incredible between them and they indulge in one fantastic one night stand in the club's storage closet.  Holly leaves right after their hot encounter and leaves Carson dumbfounded.  A month later, they run into each other at a wedding and they both couldn't forget their best sex ever experience in the closet.  He wants to start dating her, only problem is Holly is not looking for a relationship at the time.  Holly was still mending a broken heart, was busy with school, work and family obligations.  She just wanted sex and he turned her down.  He changes his mind and finds her, he is hoping to sleep with her and then slowly charm his way into her life.  Things were not going according to plan and soon Carson finds himself out of Holly's life.This story was short, sweet, fun and full of sexiness. It is not meant to be a full novel, but it is complete with everything I am looking for in a quick read: romance, steamy scenes and humor.

The only reason I forced myself to continue reading this whole joke--which only fueled my anger--was because I had hoped they would grow and mature. Their issues, especially the heroines, are petty and insignificant like those of a tween with her first zit and equating it to the end of the universe.The writing was okay, but dialog was pretty crappy. Fraught with too many Uh's and Um's for my taste... kind of like that of a child who's vocabulary hasn't been expanded on by education yet. Editing is excellent! It's odd... great books are always poorly edited and poor books are always superbly edited in my experience. Oh well. Unless you like to read YA's with child-like characters, I do NOT recommend this book. I certainly won't be reading the other books in the series because, judging by the other characters in this one, they're all of questionable maturity as well. Except Will...maybe.

All of them are about sexy guys, steamy sex, and each guy is totally devoted to one woman (with the exception of #9 - two guys one woman).  I am so pleased that the author is not using undesirable plot devices that are used by too many romance authors.  What she does NOT use:1.  stupidity2.  the big misunderstanding3.  one person falls in love and decides to break up with the other, because it will hurt too much if they break up in the future.Yay!!!  Thank you Ms. Kennedy for not using these.  I can enjoy these stories.I don&#8217;t want to read novellas, and there are six of them in this series.

She just broke up with a demanding ex, she wants to start her own restaurant, and her family members are constantly getting themselves into trouble.  A one-night stand is just what she needed.  Then said one-night stand shows up at a wedding she's catering and Holly finds she can't resist the attraction between them.  But where she wants a fling, Carson wants a relationship.  Holly's about to learn just how determined one sexy SEAL can be.One thing's for sure - Heat of Passion is hot, hot, HOT!  Elle Kennedy delivers a wonderful romance that'll make you smile even as it makes you sweat.I first fell in love with Carson in the first Out of Uniform story, Heat of the Moment.  With his sensual, charming exterior and the caring soul that lies beneath, how can one not fall in love with Carson?  He is everything worth drooling over, so it's easy to find why Holly found him impossible to resist.  As for the woman who catches the heart of said playboy?  Holly is a bright, loving soul who has been burned by a past relationship gone sour.  Her fears of giving all of herself in a full-fledged relationship are understandable, but I really enjoyed watching Carson try to break through to her.While Heat of Passion is the second book in the Out of Uniform series, each story fully stands on its own.  However, fans of Heat of the Moment will no doubt delight in seeing Carson's best friend, Garrett, and his bride Shelby once more.  Heat of Passion also gives readers a little insight into Lieutenant Will Charleston whose story I am now aching for and I will be rushing to read his story, Heat of the Storm, very shortly.A passionate, engaging story that I could not put down, I cannot say enough good things about Heat of Passion or Ms. Kennedy's work.

Dump him right smack in the middle of California with a woman named Dorothy. A shy, curvy, and push over female that also happens to be a witch. A very powerful witch that is also the soul mate to said hot `Wizard of Oz'. After a fantastic `light bondage' (no ropes, think invisible bondage Wizard of Oz style) the Wizard is summoned back to Oz, and leaves our poor Dorothy with a way into Oz if she should need to come to him.This story was laced with hot erotic scenes and was even better than Not in Kansas. It added in more elements of the original story, you get a takes of Glinda, some `flying monkeys', and other mystical creatures that all over sexed and aren't ashamed of it. Let me tell you, if I had known that Oz was the land of sex, I would have hopped on the first Twister and taken my happy butt there a long time ago.I think this story had more of a pleasing effect on me because of the light bondage and spanking that was in it. This was one of the most pleasing erotic romances I have read in a very long time. The fantasy was great, the storyline was new and fresh, and I wish she would write just ONE MORE in this series so I can sit back and indulge in another trip to the land of Oz.Review also found at: [...]","01 13, 2012",ASLSCL3KWHFSE,Future Slayer Girl (aka: kitten),Surrender Dorothy,1326412800

I bought this because the plot seemed interesting--ancient vampire who has been disturbed by a young woman buying and moving in the old farmhouse over his lair.  It had promise--promise that the author couldn't fulfill.The book was written as if the author had a formula to write by: Introduce main characters, immediately have them have dream sex, then have male lead tell her that she is his one, and BTW he's a vampire and then have sex for the rest of the story.  No building up of the plot or tension between characters which lead to any type of climax (non-sexual type) and resolution.

Because of how Debra handled her attraction to Maddox before this, I didn't think she was yet at the stage where she'd give in to her, and his, lust. I would also have liked to see more story before the sex scene, which was long and fairly explicit. The book began at a good pace, but after the above-mentioned scene, it was very rushed, flying along as if out of control. Carsen could have written a longer book instead of filling the latter part with excerpts of her other books. But, having said that, she did well with her story within the restrictions imposed by a novella-length book.Quibbles aside, if you want a short, excellently written, entertaining read with humor, romance and some excitement, you'll like Carolina Wolf.

She started contacting Bryan, but never got a reply. When she did get a reply Bryan said he didn't know her. Morgan was a music teacher. Her school district had to let her go because of budget cuts. Morgan packed up everything and moved to Chicago. She was going to see Bryan face to face and no one was going to stop her! When she got to Bryan's office, his sectary said that he was busy and told her to make an appointment. Morgan barged into a conference room, and asked to see Bryan. This handsome, tall man that she had never seen before said I am Bryan. Before she could retreat, her water broke, and her contractions were painful, keeping her rooted to where she stood. He picked her up and took her to his office and laid her on his couch. When she was in the office she saw a picture of the person she knew as Bryan, with the man that just said he was Bryan. She pointed and said that is Bryan, I want to see him now. Bryan said that is my brother Dillon, and I'm afraid you can't see him. Dillon died 6 months ago. Dillon would often take trips and use his brother's name, and his credit cards, leaving Bryan to clean up his mess. The ambulance came, and Bryan asked Morgan who he could call for her. She said no body.  Morgan was an only child, and both of her parents had died the month before Morgan took her trip to Aruba. The Cailborn family was very wealthy, so everyone thought Morgan was there as a gold digger. In truth she was there because she wanted her son to know his family. This story really touched my heart. When everyone finally trusted Morgan to be who she really was, everyone loved and accepted her. I loved it the first time she met Bryan's parents. There were tears shed.

Lessons about God can be given without copy/pasting scripture.

This is the nauseating type of Christian.Vivian has a baby out of wedlock and is always thinking she's about to be smite down for her grave sin. The relationship between her and her baby is weird. Sure she was raised in an orphanage from 14 to 20 but still. EVERY woman knows you breastfeed a baby. How she never clued in that the baby needs to be breastfed is ridiculous. Billy notices but never mentions it.She didn't act like the baby's mother and she even mentions having a friend at the orphanage who was good with the babies. Well, Marie sure didn't tell her anything about babies because even monkeys have better natural parenting skills.

Kansas is a independent wealthy man who decided to live like an hermit in his family land. When he is swept away from a tornado, no one notices his absence, and so Kansas is free to enjoy is adventure.He awakes in a strange world, inhabited by half-man half-beast being; the first two he meets are a cat like man and a bird like woman, a strange couple indeed. When the two find this strange being with bare skin and blue eyes, they think that it would be a nice gift for their king and decide to bring Kansas to him, even if the cat-like man would like to have a taste. In this world sensuality is the normal behavior and sex is almost a recreational activity; Kansas will discover that even a simple bath in a pond has sexual consequences, and not thanks to another being, but since the waters are alive.When Kansas arrives to the king's palace, the first human-like man he meets is Z, a wizard. He is almost ""normal"" if not for the fact that he is extremely handsome and gold colored. Z. tells Kansas that, if he wants to have the chance to go back to home, he should refuse the king... and here maybe The Wizard of Oz mixed with One Thousand and One Nights. And here maybe is where I'd like the story to be a bit longer: there is an acceleration that brings the reader to the end of the story when it would be interesting to have more; the relationship between the King and Kansas is only hinted, and almost chaste in comparison to all the other sexual experiences Kansas had before ""consorting"" with the King.Naughty thought on the title: Not in Kansas means that the story is not setting in Kansas like The Wizard of Oz, or that the King is not allowed to ""enter"" Kansas (and I don't mean the State...)Anyway as I said the story is nice and enjoyable, more funny than serious; this is not the classical fantasy tale heavy in details, but it's more a funny escapade in a world that maybe is the dream world in Kansas' mind.","01 30, 2013",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Not in Kansas by R.G.

5886,B002HJV41Q,"[0, 1]",4,"Madeline `Maddie' Carpenter's life hasn't changed since she won the lottery one year ago along with her best friends Brittney and Lauren.  Rather than go on a spending binge she still lives in the same house, works the same job, and hasn't indulged in anything life altering that most people who play the lottery dream of doing.  Her life is very ordinary - at least it was until the evening of Brittney's wedding when Maddie dares to step out of her comfort zone and accept the wedding reception singer's not so subtle offer to visit his hotel room.Tanner Robinson is a singing superstar who just happens to occasionally agree to do private performances.  He's agreed to sing at Brittney's reception but there's a tinge of resentment in doing so since all his love songs were written for his ex-wife, who'd left him for a woman.  He'd just received his final divorce papers the day before and that just adds to his discontent and frustration.  Mindless sex has been a great way to alleviate his restlessness - and he goes looking for just that when he enters the hotel bar and propositions Maddie.Maddie isn't like any of the women Tanner's been photographed with or use to for that matter.  She's not `Hollywood,' she's real - no flashy clothes, rabbit food diet, and no ulterior motive for sharing time with him.  He might have gone looking for a one night fling, but what he found is a woman he can't resist - and he honestly isn't sure how he feels about that.  One thing's certain, even once he returns to his normally busy recording schedule he can't stop thinking about her.  Maddie carries her own insecurities but she's willing to risk her heart for Tanner, but is she prepared for the pretentious world of a popular singer?  What about Tanner... can he let go of his ex-wife's betrayal and find a happily-ever-after with a woman who's paralyzed with fear of changing anything in her life?Who hasn't dreamed of the changes they'd make in their lives if they could just pick those lucky numbers?  Now imagine if you actually did win but making any of those changes is just too overwhelming.  Karen Erickson's FORTUNE'S PROMISE provides readers with just such a scenario and throws in a newly divorced popular singer just to complicate matters - the results are decidedly entertaining and highly memorable.  As a reader I found it very easy to relate to Maddie and her discomfort with change but loved that she steps out of her comfort zone with Tanner for an undeniably naughty night.  FORTUNE'S PROMISE is a beautiful story of two people moving past their fears, letting go of their pasts and embracing the possibilities of a future together.  It's definitely a story that just makes you feel good about life in general - even if you don't win the lottery.I confess I haven't read the other titles in the FORTUNE's series so obviously the books can be read as stand alones but I'm definitely curious enough about Brittney and Lauren that I'll be picking up copies of the other stories soon.  Here are the titles in the FORTUNE series in order:FORTUNE'S DECEPTIONFORTUNE'S PROMISEFORTUNE'S CHANCEOr if you prefer your books in print format pick up a copy of LUCK OF THE DRAW which contains all three of the FORTUNE stories.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","08 8, 2013",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

Convincing her to leave her world and life to mate with them and relocate is a daunting task.

It's well-written and edited enough, resulting in a polished and driving book.But it's not vintage Lanyon, and that may be the problem for me. None of his wonderful dry wit. None of his effortless twisting of plot and characters. And, most definitely not Lanyon, it is rife with gay romance conventions and formulas.Dear God, can anyone write gay fiction, any more, without a tear-jerking hospital stay or handicapped heroes? Not to mention the gratuitous &#34;need to be dominated&#34; theme that seems to have grown out of the market popularity of 50 Shades of Grey?Honestly, it seems such a waste to squander such lush characters and fast-paced writing on 20-page sex scenes and trite (but apparently obligatory) M/M romance memes.Fortunately, this was an early work (Kindle edition published 2009) and Mr. Lanyon's subsequent writing was neither conventional nor trite. I'm so glad he found his voice and gifted us with such wonderful books.As for this one, had I known what it was, I would have gladly given it a pass.","12 14, 2013",A3O2UZACDPCGZ5,Alan Arthur Katz,Disappointed,1386979200

Each has quite different feel to them, almost as if truly written by different people. The first part more action and tension and grit, the second more romance and emotion and tenderness. I enjoyed both.","03 23, 2014",A3MCXCKULCGPG7,"BJ ""Dogs_R_Us""",Enjoyed this very much,1395532800

5909,B002HJV44S,"[1, 1]",4,"Wow, the first sex scene was electric for me, the details around the encounter putting it out there what these characters' personalities are like, the crumpled card at the end of the scene proving Gabriel wasn't going to just swoon into love. Their dangerous jobs set up an awesome background for the play out of their interactions. I loved the opposites; Miguel the older, slower lover teaching his firecracker of a lover to savor things, Gabriel the race-to-the-end and devour life younger man. The scene in the bedroom with the shot glasses was erotic and delicious, showing just how much work Miguel had ahead of him in drawing his elusive lover in close. Then something happens and utterly, irrevocably changes their relationship. It turned a spicy fire connection into a mellow warmth for the latter part of the book and left me feeling like I started out reading one book and ended in another not so thrilling.","09 25, 2012",A25XH6ERWF8R11,~CKH~,So close...,1348531200
5910,B002HJV44S,"[0, 0]",3,"I liked this book, but I didn't love it. There were some pacing issues for me. Also, I liked the characters, well I liked Lorenzo, and I am ambivalent about Sandalini.This book featured an SFPD detective, Gabriel Sandalini, and an FBI agent, Antonio Lorenzo who went deep undercover to bust a mexican drug cartel. From the beginning, Lorenzo & Sandlini were drawn to each other, but they were unaware that the other was one of the good guys.So they fought their attraction because 1) it was disturbing being attracted to such a bad character and 2) there would be no future as betrayal and arrests were inevitable.Unfortunately, one of them got their cover blown. Now they are in the fight of their lives. It's hard to even focus on love, when you have to watch your back against everyone.I never connected with Sandalini. He was a reckless smart mouth kid. He wasn't as tough as he thought he was. He was annoying. then I didn't understand how a hardened agent like Lorenzo could be so sensitive when he comes to Sandalini. I like them together but something was missing for me. I think it was the writing. It was too sterile for me. the only real show of emotion from Sandalini was a prelude to sex or during sex or post sex. Whereas Lorenzo wore his heart on his sleeve. I don't know how the heck Lorenzo made it as an FBI undercover agent. He is too nice. I would have liked him to be vocal with Gabriel. I will read book 2 to see they are progressing.","02 7, 2014",A27KU0C98ZSTM9,Ezinwanyi,3.5 stars,1391731200

It picks up the pace quickly and moves right along until the end.Gabriel is kind of a cocky ass at times, but once you learn more about him, it is hard not to like him. He is a total wiseass and had me chuckling out loud more than once.Antonio is one hell of a sexy Spaniard. I loved his way of speaking and could almost hear that sexy accent whispering in my ear. He and Gabriel are smoking together and comploment each other perfectly.I would read more about these two any time.","08 3, 2012",A12Q8MINR3GIU6,JustJen,Loved,1343952000
